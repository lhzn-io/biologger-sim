# 3D Assets

This directory contains the 3D assets used by the Omniverse simulation.

**Note:** Large binary assets (GLB, textures, high-poly models) are **NOT** tracked in this repository to keep the repo size manageable and to respect licensing agreements for paid models.

## Required Assets

To run the simulation, you need to download the following assets and place them in this directory:

| File Name | Description | Source / Download Link |
|-----------|-------------|------------------------|
| `great_white_shark.glb` | 3D Model of the Great White Shark | [Download Link] |
