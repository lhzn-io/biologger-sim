# Technical Documentation

This directory is a placeholder for technical documentation summaries in markdown format, optimized for GitHub Copilot Spaces integration.

## Current Status

This directory currently contains only this README file. Technical documentation will be added as markdown summaries are created from PDF sources using the markitdown MCP server.

## Planned Content

Future markdown summaries will include:

- Hardware specifications and capabilities
- Deployment procedures and best practices
- Data collection parameters and settings
- Sensor calibration methodologies
- Battery management and power considerations
- Data processing workflows

## Available Resources (Local Only)

Technical manuals and hardware documentation are currently available as PDF files stored locally but excluded from the repository per the project's Copilot Spaces-friendly file management strategy.
