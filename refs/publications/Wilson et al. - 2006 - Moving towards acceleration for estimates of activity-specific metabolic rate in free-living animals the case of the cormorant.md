Time and energy are key currencies in animal ecology, and judicious management of
these is a primary focus for natural selection. At present, however, there are only two main

Introduction

et al

Rate of energy expenditure is a cornerstone to under-
standing  animal  ecology.  All  animals  expend  energy
and judicious expenditure, mediated via movement of
body  parts  (e.g.  in  locomotion;  Alexander  2003)  or
physiological/behavioural  traits  (e.g.  hibernation/
torpor; Geiser 2004) is critical in survival and thus is a
primary focus for natural selection (Brown
. 2004).
Comprehensive  investigations  into  the  behavioural
ecology  of  animals  therefore  necessitate  that  energy
turnover and, in particular, the allocation of energy to
speciﬁc activities, be measured (McNamara & Houston
1996).  Currently,  however,  there  are  only  two  major
methods  for  estimating  rate  of  energy  expenditure
(metabolic rate) in the ﬁeld, the doubly labelled water
method, which provides an estimate of total produc-
tion of carbon dioxide over the experimental period,
and the heart-rate method which, when appropriately
calibrated, provides an estimate of rate of oxygen con-
sumption over relatively short as well as over long time
periods.

et al

et al

. 2001; Watanabe

Although both these methods have been used with
varying degrees of success, both have their limitations;
the  doubly  labelled  water  method  generally  cannot
resolve the energetic costs of speciﬁc activities while the
heart rate method normally involves surgical implan-
tation (and removal) of loggers, with all the operational
complications that this involves (see Butler
. 2004
for detailed discussion). Here, we propose a third method
for estimating activity-speciﬁc metabolic rates in the ﬁeld
using accelerometry. Accelerometers are tiny, inexpen-
sive transducers that can be integrated into loggers for
deployment on animals (Ropert-Coudert & Wilson 2005).
Such units can be attached to animals externally in a
matter of seconds or minutes using conventional tag-
attaching techniques (Yoda
.
et al
2005). As such, these loggers are accessible, useful tools
for a suite of biologists. Internal implantation of these
loggers is also a possibility, at least on avian species,
and although a more complex method of deployment,
circumvents the potential impact on the subject animal
. 2000).
of external deployment (Ropert-Coudert
The overall rate of energy expenditure of an adult
animal at any one time can be allocated primarily to
four  bodily  functions;  basal  metabolic  rate  (BMR)
(Frappell & Butler 2004; McKechnie & Wolf  2004;
McKechnie,  Freckleton  &  Jetz  2006),  temperature-
dependent  energetic  expenditure  (Beamish  1990),
speciﬁc dynamic action (SDA) (e.g. Hawkins
. 1997)
and movement (e.g. Alexander 2003). The magnitude
of these elements is relatively well understood (White &
Seymour 2005) and values for BMR and SDA can be
ascribed fairly accurately for free-living animals as a
result of  indirect calorimetric studies undertaken in
the  laboratory  (Rosen  &  Trites  1997).  In  addition,
temperature-dependent rate of energy expenditure can
be alluded to if the environmental conditions to which
the  animals  are  exposed  are  known  (McNab  2002).

Animal activity is deﬁned largely in terms of movement,
and muscular contraction, which requires the expendi-
ture of energy, is responsible for this movement (King,
Loiselle & Kohl 2004). Hence, accurate quantiﬁcation
of movement should correlate with the energy expended
to produce it. Animal movement is typiﬁed by variable
acceleration, and measurement of acceleration is becom-
ing established as a reliable method of  quantifying
activity patterns of animals in the ﬁeld (e.g. Yoda
.
et al
2001). Thus, we postulate that accurate measurement
of acceleration of an animal in all three spatial dimen-
sions should provide a good estimate of their rate of
energy  expenditure  while  moving.  Preliminary  work
using simple accelerometers on humans, working in just
one or two dimensions, has shown that the degree of
acceleration does indeed correlate with rate of energy
expenditure assessed by rate of  oxygen consumption
or carbon dioxide production (Campbell, Crocker &
.  2003;  Fruin  &  Rankin
et al
McKenzie  2002;  Hoos
2004; Kumahara
. 2004). Thus, the accelerometry
technique has the potential to provide information about
how animals partition their use of both time and energy.
In the present paper, we demonstrate the utility of
accelerometric estimation of rate of energy expenditure
using electronic devices attached to great cormorants
(
),  which  measured  their  body
Phalacrocorax  carbo
acceleration  while  they  were  engaged  in  different
activities  on  land  in  the  laboratory.  Using  standard
respirometry techniques (Withers 2001), we were able
to  investigate  the  extent  to  which  body  acceleration
correlates with the rate of oxygen consumption (
, an
indirect measure of metabolic rate that can be converted
to rate of energy expenditure) during activity in this
species. We also examined how body acceleration varies
as a function of activity in free-living imperial cormo-
rants (

expected  trends  in

Downloaded acceleration data from the three axes were
converted  from  mV  into  g  using  the  calibrations  of
transducer output vs. transducer angle with respect to
gravity (see above) and the three signals were individually
smoothed using running means over 1 s. Then for each
channel, the speciﬁc values for the smoothed data for
any particular time interval were subtracted from the
corresponding unsmoothed data for that time interval
to produce a value for g resulting primarily from the
dynamic acceleration (the static acceleration resulting
from  body  angle  with  respect  to  gravity  having  been
removed).  Derived  values  were  then  converted  into
absolute positive units and the resultant values from all
three channels then added to each other to give an overall
value for the triaxial dynamic acceleration experienced
by the birds. These values were then used in regressions

As the experimental design involved the participa-
tion  of  each  bird  in  only  a  single  respirometry  and
accelerometry  session  it  was  not  possible  to  include
body mass as a ﬁxed factor in the analysis, because bird
identity  and  body  mass  were  perfectly  confounded.
However, body mass is potentially correlated with both
, and might therefore be a useful addi-
ODBA and
tional parameter in a model used to predict
 from
ODBA. It was therefore important to check whether
there was a signiﬁcant effect of body mass on
, or if
there was a signiﬁcant interaction between body mass
and ODBA. Thus, to circumvent the problem of a single
mass value for each bird, one ODBA and
 pair were
selected randomly for each bird, and the effect of body
 were examined ﬁrst with a full
mass and ODBA on
factorial analysis of variance () with body mass
and ODBA as ﬁxed factors and, if the interaction term
was not signiﬁcant, with an  with body mass as
 pairs
a covariate. Because at least ﬁve ODBA and
were available for each bird this procedure was repeated
ﬁve times, and α was set at a Bonferroni corrected level
√O2
of 0·01. No ODBA and
 pair was included in more
than one analysis, and care was taken to ensure that
each subset contained a wide range of ODBA values
(i.e. each subset of ﬁve data pairs included at least two
pairs  measured  during  walking,  and  two  measured
during non-walking periods).

that a range of
 values was obtained both during
periods of walking and periods of non-walking, to try
to ensure that the range of
 for walking and non-
walking  overlapped.  However,  initial  data  analysis
showed that ODBA values for walking and non-walking
did not overlap, and visual inspection suggested that
the  walking  and  non-walking  periods  may  be  best
described by separate relationships. While techniques
for ﬁtting two-part regressions exist (e.g. Chappell 1989;
Nickerson, Facey & Grossman 1989; Yeager & Ultsch
1989), these methods nevertheless require a subjective
judgement about which of the single-phase and two-
phase ﬁts is most appropriate. In the present case it could
reasonably be hypothesized, a priori, that a single-phase
regression is appropriate because ODBA integrates all
mechanical work performed by the animal, or that a
two-phase regression is appropriate because the loca-
tion of the logger in close association with the trunk
will  emphasize  locomotory  movements  of  the  body,
and be less sensitive to movements of the extremities
(e.g. the head and neck during preening). Thus, in order
to compare the single-phase and two-phase ﬁts objec-
tively,  and  determine  which  is  most  appropriate,  we
adopted Burnham & Anderson’s (2001) approach for
model comparison and calculated Akaike’s information
criterion (AIC) as a measure of model ﬁt for both the
single-phase and two-phase models. AIC was calculated
as −2× the log-likelihood of the model, plus 2× the number
of estimable parameters (Burnham & Anderson 2001).
This addition penalizes the number of parameters in a
model, ensuring that the best model is not necessarily
the one with the most parameters. The best model was
the  one  with  the  lowest  AIC.  The  probability  that  a
model was the best of the two tested was measured by
its  Akaike  weight  (Burnham  &  Anderson  2001),  the
relative likelihood of a model compared to the other.

depth (e.g. Figure 4a). This was due primarily to the
birds being subject to decreasing upthrust (Fig. 4b), as
plumage  and  respiratory  air  volume  decreased  with
depth (Wilson et al. 1992) and as rate of descent did not
vary during the course of such dives (P > 0·05). ODBA
also  varied  for  ﬂight,  being  systematically  lower  in
birds setting out to forage (x = 0·826, SD 0·087, n = 12;
t = 3·17, P < 0·01) than in birds returning from forag-
ing  (x = 0·944,  SD  0·095,  n = 12),  presumably  laden
with food and probably also with water (Ribak, Weihs

The  signiﬁcant  positive  relationship  between  rate  of
oxygen consumption (
) and overall dynamic body
acceleration (ODBA) (Fig. 2) indicates that the accel-
erometry technique is a potentially useful method for
 in cormorants.

Accurate determination of activity-speciﬁc
 is crit-
ical  because,  during  activity,  the  costs  of  movement
may outweigh those of any of the other functions by a
factor  of  more  than  10  (Darveau  et al.  2002;  Weibel
et al.  2004)  and  currently  accounts  for  most  of  the
uncertainty  in  the  compilation  of  energy  budgets  in
free-living animals. The variance that we observe in our
 and ODBA (Fig. 2) will be
relationship between
due, in part, to energy-expending processes of the body
that do not relate to movement (see below) but will also
be due to methodological errors. A number of factors
contribute to variance in the ODBA–metabolic power
relationship, discussed below.

of energy use. Thus, we have chosen to relate ODBA to

depends on the metabolic substrate being utilized. When
pure carbohydrate is metabolized and the respiratory
quotient (RQ, the ratio of CO2 formed to O2 used at the
cellular level) is 1, 1 mL O2 s−1 = 21·1 W, while for pure
fat  metabolism,  i.e.  when  RQ  is  0·71,  1 mL O2 s−1 =
19·6 W  (Butler  &  Bishop  2000).  Under  steady-state
conditions, such as those employed in the present study,
RQ  is  equivalent  to  the  respiratory  exchange  ratio
(RER,
), which is the exchange ratio at the lungs.
However, these energy equivalences have been validated
for only a few species, and there is scope for error when
converting  from
  to  rate  of   energy  expenditure
(Walsberg & Hoffman 2005). Furthermore, RER and
RQ may be lower than 0·71 in fasting birds (Nolet et al.
1992; Chaui-Berlinck & Bicudo 1995; Hawkins et al.
2000; Walsberg & Hoffman 2005), but energy equiva-
lences of O2 are available only for the range 0·71–1, and
it is not clear how data should be treated in these cases
(see Walsberg & Hoffman 2005 for further discussion).

The use of acceleration to measure movement is logical
because muscular contraction resulting in movement
produces  acceleration  (or  deceleration)  in  a  corre-
sponding moving part (usually a limb). Thus, theoret-
ically, if accelerometers were put onto all moving parts
of the body, it should be possible to quantify all move-
ment and, because muscular contraction requires the
consumption of oxygen, estimate the oxygen uptake of
the muscles associated with each of the moving parts.
However, because the moving parts of the body are all
connected with the trunk, any movement should pro-
duce a corresponding, albeit dampened, movement in
this area. In general, the more substantial the move-
ment (i.e. a greater rate of change of position) in the
extremities,  the  greater  will  be  the  movement  of  the
trunk, even if the body is not subject to some overall
translocation. Thus, single accelerometers to monitor
all elements of animal movement should be placed on
the trunk where movement in any of the extremities can
be perceived. Placement of the accelerometer system
and the exact adherence to the feathers is likely to be
critical, and slight variations of such are likely to have
produced some of the interindividual variance that we
observed  in  measured  acceleration  as  a  function  of
speed in our captive cormorants.

Although the actual overall patterns in acceleration
that the body experiences over the three spatial dimen-
sions  will  be  complex  and  dependent  on  the  various
types  of  muscle  movement,  triaxial  accelerometers
mounted  on  the  body  trunk  should  allow  accurate
quantiﬁcation of this (Pfau, Witte & Wilson 2005). For
this reason, accelerometry in the three axes is likely to
give the best correlation with
 which may, at least in
part, explain our high correlation coefﬁcients compared
to those from other studies using mono- or biaxial
transducers (Campbell et al. 2002; Hoos et al. 2003).

Indeed, the coefﬁcient of determination for the ODBA–
  relationship  reported  here  (r2 = 0·81,  Fig. 2a)  is
√O2
comparable to that reported for the fH–
 relation-
ships of king and macaroni penguins (r2 = 0·73– 0·79;
Froget et al. 2004; Green et al. 2005). Ultimately, how-
ever, the extent to which mono-, bi- or triaxial trans-
ducers are appropriate to deﬁne the energy expended
by movement will depend on the animals and the move-
ments and, in an initial phase at least, this will require
examination on a species-by-species basis.

Despite the potential that accelerometry might have
to serve as a proxy for
, and hence rate of energy
expenditure during activity, there are a number of situ-
ations which, if they are not simulated during the cal-
ibration procedure, could lead to errors. These include
the effect that elastic ligaments and tendons (Bennett
& Taylor 1995), different animal gaits (Rubenson et al.
2004)  and  resonant  frequencies  might  have  on  the
ODBA–
 relationship (Dutto et al. 2004). We note
that  substantial  elasticity  in  tendons  during  animal
movement will result in a correspondingly large accel-
eration signal, much of which actually represents energy
that can be re-used by the animal in question (Alexander
1988). In addition, it is not intuitively obvious how the
rate of energy expenditure of terrestrial animals moving
up slopes of different inclines might relate to ODBA
(Gottschall & Kram 2005).

Thus,  it  is  important  that  when  the  accelerometry
 in the ﬁeld, the
method is to be used to estimate
calibration procedure incorporates all the factors that
may  reasonably  affect  the  relationship  in  the  ﬁeld.
Similar complexities have been identiﬁed, but have not
been  a  hindrance,  with  the  heart  rate  method.  For
example, the fH–
 relationship differs between ﬂight
and treadmill exercise in geese (Ward et al. 2002). In
reptiles such as lizards, feeding, body temperature,
heating and cooling, as well as level of activity, affect
the relationship between heart rate and rate of oxygen
consumption and have to be incorporated into the ﬁnal
model (Clark, Butler & Frappell 2006). It is also impor-
tant that the accuracy of the method is determined by
performing suitable validation experiments and that, if
at  all  possible,  the  standard  error  of  the  estimate  is
determined so that mean estimates can be statistically
compared (see Green et al. 2001).

The value of ODBA in helping to determine the cost of
various activities of free-living animals can be demon-
strated  by  examining  the  data  on  the  behaviour  of
imperial cormorants in Patagonia to highlight certain
trends. As pointed out by Yoda et al. (2001) and Watanabe

et al.  (2005),  accelerometers  are  generally  useful  for
determining different categories of animal behaviour
(Ropert-Coudert  et al.  2004)  and  this  is  certainly
apparent in our results. Beyond this, however, authors
have also been able to allude to the biomechanics of
locomotion, for example examining the effect of air-
mediated  buoyancy  on  stroke  frequency  during  the
descent and ascent in diving mammals and birds (Sato
et al. 2003; Watanuki et al. 2005). The effects of depth
are apparent in that stroke frequency tends to decrease
with increasing depth during the descent of birds due to
compression  of  the  respiratory  system  and  hence  a
reduction in buoyancy (Wilson et al. 1992), while ascent
is largely passive (Watanuki et al. 2003; Kato et al. 2006).
The  reverse  is  generally  true  of   marine  mammals,
which are negatively buoyant below about 50 m depth
(Sato et al. 2003; Williams et al. 2000). While it seems
clear  that  the  costs  of   swimming  at  depth  in  both
mammals and birds will be indicated by limb stroke
frequency, the inability of systems to integrate stroke
√O2
amplitude (cf. Wilson & Liebsch 2003) means that
while swimming at depth either has to be determined
directly using respirometry techniques, usually under
laboratory-type conditions (Williams et al. 2004; Enstipp,
Gremillet & Jones 2006), or indirectly using the heart
rate method on free-ranging animals in the ﬁeld (Froget
et al. 2004; Green et al. 2003), although for both these
methods  the  values  obtained  integrate  costs  for  the
 during dives
whole dive/surface period. Alternatively,
can be estimated based on mechanical models (Lovvorn,
Croll & Liggins 1999), or estimated indirectly using a
multiple regression approach (Woakes & Butler 1983;
Halsey, Butler & Woakes 2005).

Our ODBA data from imperial cormorants clearly
show a decreasing ODBA with increasing depth when
constant  rates  of   descent  are  maintained.  Indeed,
calculation of the upthrust experienced by these birds
shows that 97% of the variance in ODBA is explained
by air volumes, which is to be expected if ODBA relates
to the
 involved in the descent. An ODBA of 0·17 g
is predicted for birds descending at a vertical rate of
1·17 m s−1 (rate of descent did not change with depth in
dives to 40 m), with an increase of 0·12 g for every N
upthrust experienced (Fig. 4b). ODBA decreased, on
average,  by  54%  during  descent  from  3·2  to  37·0 m;
thus, if we assume that the relationship between ODBA
and
 is similar for walking great cormorants (Fig. 2)
and swimming imperial cormorants, this represents a
32% decrease in
. Similarly, the use of ODBA as a
measure of energy expended can be expanded to other
power-variable activities such as ﬂight. Our results show,
for  example,  that  the  ODBA  for  cormorants  ﬂying
while  laden  with  food  for  their  chicks  is  14%  higher
than  when  ﬂying  unladen  (cf.  Hambly,  Harper  &
Speakman  2004).  Again,  assuming  that  our  great
cormorant relationship between ODBA and
 can be
used on imperial cormorants,
 when laden is estimated
to be 8·5% higher than when unladen. It is not known
 relationship determined in the present
if the ODBA–

study is relevant to a ﬂying bird, but the difference in
ODBA between empty and laden birds suggests that
the technique does show promise. Although experiments
have been conducted to examine the energetic conse-
quences  of  loading  terrestrial  animals  (e.g.  Irschick
et al. 2003), this is rare in ﬂying animals (Gessaman &
Nagy  1988;  Videler  et al.  1988;  see  also  Butler  et al.
1998; who documented a decrease in heart rate during
the autumn migratory ﬂight of barnacle geese as they
lost body mass). There are obvious difﬁculties in deter-
mining the energetic cost of ﬂight, even though quanti-
ﬁcation of the energetic costs of transporting extra mass
by ﬂying species is critical in understanding a variety of
behavioural strategies (Lindstrom & Alerstam 1992).

Given the limitations and difﬁculties involved in meas-
uring rate of energy expenditure of free-living animals
(Butler et al. 2004), measurement of triaxial dynamic
acceleration appears to have great potential for deriv-
ing  the  energy  expenditure  involved  in  locomotion.
Furthermore, it may also be possible to derive estimates
of energy expenditure during other types of movement,
such as respiration, and to combine accelerometry with
measurements  of  other  variables  such  as  depth  (e.g.
Fig. 3a),  body  temperature  and  heart  rate.  Although
the  present  study  has  highlighted  a  large  number  of
areas where the methodology may be subject to error,
the overall goodness-of-ﬁt of ODBA with
 from our
laboratory data (Fig. 2) coupled with clear, explicable
trends  from  free-living  birds  obliged  to  work  under
conditions of varying mechanical power (Figs 4 and 5)
indicate that the concept is fairly robust. This, together
with the ability of accelerometry to identify behaviours
(Watanabe et al. 2005), should ultimately allow researchers
to  determine  how  free-living  animals  partition  their
time and energy into particular behavioural strategies.
