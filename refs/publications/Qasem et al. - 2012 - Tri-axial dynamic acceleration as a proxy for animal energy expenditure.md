Abstract

Dynamic body acceleration (DBA) has been used as a proxy for energy expenditure in logger-equipped animals, with
researchers summing the acceleration (overall dynamic body acceleration - ODBA) from the three orthogonal axes of
devices. The vector of the dynamic body acceleration (VeDBA) may be a better proxy so this study compared ODBA and
VeDBA as proxies for rate of oxygen consumption using humans and 6 other species. Twenty-one humans on a treadmill ran
at different speeds while equipped with two loggers, one in a straight orientation and the other skewed, while rate of
oxygen consumption ( _VV O2) was recorded. Similar data were obtained from animals but using only one (straight) logger. In
humans, both ODBA and VeDBA were good proxies for_VV O2 with all r2 values exceeding 0.88, although ODBA accounted for
slightly but significantly more of the variation in _VV O2 than did VeDBA (P,0.03). There were no significant differences
between ODBA and VeDBA in terms of the change in_VV O2 estimated by the acceleration data in a simulated situation of the
logger being mounted straight but then becoming skewed (P = 0.744). In the animal study, ODBA and VeDBA were again
good proxies for _VV O2 with all r2 values exceeding 0.70 although, again, ODBA accounted for slightly, but significantly, more
of the variation in_VV O2 than did VeDBA (P,0.03). The simultaneous contraction of muscles, inserted variously for limb
stability, may produce muscle oxygen use that at least partially equates with summing components to derive DBA. Thus, a
vectorial summation to derive DBA cannot be assumed to be the more ‘correct’ calculation. However, although within the
limitations of our simple study, ODBA appears a marginally better proxy for _VV O2. In the unusual situation where researchers
are unable to guarantee at least reasonably consistent device orientation, they should use VeDBA as a proxy for_VVO2.

Introduction

The broad interest in animal optimal foraging [1] underpins the
central concept that creatures should behave in such a way as to
maximize their inclusive fitness by maximizing their net rate of
energy intake [see 2,3]. This
includes optimized harvesting
solutions [e.g. 4,5,6] but also minimizing locomotion costs in
animals that have to move to acquire food [7]. Thus, information
on the rate at which organisms expend energy during movement is
fundamental to informing models of optimal foraging and indeed,
ultimately, the efficiency of movement affects the survival of wild
animals [8]. Understanding optimality in foraging is only one
example that demonstrates the importance of being able to
determine energy expenditure but it, like many other biological
processes, is best informed by energy expenditure at a fine-scale
temporal resolution, something that is notably rare in published
studies with some exceptions [9,10,11,12]. This situation stems

from a paucity of appropriate methods for determining the power
use of wild animals.

some proxy for energy expenditure such as heart beat rate (fH)

the above systems have disadvantages
[reviewed by 20,24] which distill out into giving poor temporal
resolution (doubly labelled water), being confined to a laboratory
situation (calorimetry) or generally involving invasive methods of
instrumentation (heart rate). See Halsey [25] and references
therein for further details.

Beyond these approaches, however, some researchers have
examined the use of mechanical motion sensors [26,27] in studies
of animal power use. In fact, as early as 1963, researchers
proposed that the extent of body movement should act as a proxy
for energy expenditure [28] because in order to elicit movement,

animals need to expend energy, with more pronounced and
vigorous movements presumed to arise as a result of more energy
expended [e.g. 29,30,31]. Thus, specifically, energy expenditure
should correlate with the extent of movement in some manner
[32,33].
In 2006, an acceleration-based proxy for energy
expenditure focusing on dynamic body acceleration (DBA) was
proposed, using tri-axial acceleration data derived from a logger
(.10 Hz) and placed close to the
recording at high rates
participant’s centre of gravity [34]. The specific proxy for
metabolic rate was overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA),
determined by adding the dynamic acceleration from three
orthogonally-placed accelerometers orientated so as to represent
the main axes of the animal’s body; in the surge, heave and sway
dimensions [34]. Although this original work was conducted on
birds, subsequent studies confirmed linear, strong correlations
between the rate of oxygen consumption ( _VV O2) and ODBA in fish
[35], amphibians [36], birds [34,37,38] and mammals [12,39],
including man [39].

the axes of

the logger with respect

Despite the promise of the newly proposed ODBA method,
however, Gleiss, Wilson et. al. [24] point to an uncertainty in its
formulation. Actually, acceleration is a vectorial quantity so it
that ODBA should treat each axis as
might seem incorrect
independent because the implication is that the ODBA metric
represents work done by three distinct straight-line paths and thus
overestimates
the work done for any specific movement.
Furthermore, ODBA values are expected to differ according to
the alignment of
to the
equipped participant, something that should not affect a vectorial
solution [24]. The suggestion, therefore, is that properly calculated
vectorial dynamic body acceleration (VeDBA) may, in fact, prove a
better, and a more appropriate proxy for metabolic rate than does
ODBA. Indeed, a recent study by McGregor, Busa et al. [40] uses
VeDBA (although not referred to as such) rather than ODBA as a
from a mathematical
proxy of
perspective both ODBA and VeDBA are norms and so are equally
valid ways to measure the length of a vector. To ascertain which
_VV O2 is difficult because there is no
derivative is a better proxy of
expected mathematical relationship that can be examined to
calculate the impact of using different norms. Furthermore, the
empirical relationship will depend on the species, the data logger
location on the animal, and the behaviour and locomotion gait(s)
of the animal. Thus a direct test of the predictive power of ODBA
and VeDBA is required, yet Gleiss, Wilson et al. [24] note that no
studies have explicitly sought to determine whether ODBA or
VeDBA is a better predictor of metabolic rate and whether the
outcome of such a test might be influenced by logger orientation
on the animal.

_VVO2. On the other hand,

The present study attempts to determine whether ODBA or
VeDBA is a better proxy for rate of oxygen consumption. Humans
are used as a model species [cf. 39] and primary data collected
while people move at different speeds on a treadmill are analysed
in detail. This is supplemented by reanalysis of published data [12]
for six other animal species. The implications of the findings are
discussed in terms of the most appropriate way to derive dynamic
body acceleration in the future.

Materials and Methods

The human study

Twenty-one healthy adults (mean age 6 SD: 20.4463.28 years)
were involved in the study. Before the start of the experiment, the
height (1.7560.07 m) and weight (70.6669.78 kg) of the partic-
ipants were measured according to the International Standards for
Anthropometric Assessment (2001). The experimental protocol

Dynamic Body Acceleration as a Proxy for Power Use

was approved by the Swansea University Ethics Committee. All
participants were asked to give informed consent before the trials
began.

Broadly,

the investigations compared the rate of oxygen
consumption during locomotion by humans on a treadmill while
back-mounted loggers recorded tri-axial acceleration.

Specifically, all participants performed a VO2 max test [40] on
a treadmill
(Woodway Ergo ELG 55; Woodway GmbH,
Germany) that started at 3 km/h and increased in speed every
3 min by 1 km/h until participant volitional exhaustion. During
this process the participants breathed into a mask, and expired air
was analyzed for oxygen and carbon dioxide content using an
Oxycon Pro (Jaeger Oxycon Manual
(Version 4.5), VIASYS
Healthcare GmbH, Hoechberg, Germany) on a breath-by-breath
basis. Acceleration was measured using two tri-axial accelerom-
eters (X6-1A USB; Gulf Coast Data Concepts, LLC, Waveland,
USA; 16 bit resolution, recording range 66 g), each set to record
at 80 Hz on each of the three orthogonal axes. The loggers were
placed within holding moulds cut into a single polystyrene saddle
to ensure correct orientation; one unit was mounted in accordance
with the main body axes of surge, heave and sway while the other
was set to be 30u displaced from this on all axes. This skew-
mounted accelerometer was rotated by 30u about the roll, pitch
and yaw axes respectively, where the roll axis was taken as the long
axis of the accelerometer. The saddle was optimised by trial and
error during pilot studies to move properly with the participant’s
body. It was placed in the centre of the participant’s back between
the shoulder blades and held in place using a specially made
SilasticH (SilasticH P1 Base and Curing Agent, Thomson Bros
Newcastle Ltd) harness which kept the system in a stable position
even during the most vigorous of movement.

villosus)

Data previously gathered comparing _VV O2with acceleration data
for animals during activity on a treadmill at Buenos Aires Zoo [12]
were reanalyzed to supplement the work on humans. Species used
were; coypu (Myocastor coypus) (4 individuals), larger hairy armadillo
(Chaetophractus
(1 individual), Muscovy duck (Cairina
moschata) (1 individual), greylag goose (Anser anser) (2 individuals),
Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus)
(2 individuals) and
rockhopper penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome)
(1 individual). Briefly,
animals were equipped with acceleration data loggers, attached
variously, before being exposed to a treadmill with the tread
moving at a range of speeds between 0 and 2.52 km/h, the upper
limit dependent on their capacities. The animals were given rests
between the higher speeds where the predominant behavior was
locomotion however at the lower speeds the animal typically
exhibited a range of behaviors including searching, scratching and
lying. An open circuitry respirometry system was used to measure
_VV O2. Full details of the protocol are given in Halsey et al. [12].

Data analysis

The raw accelerometer data were converted to DBA by first
smoothing each channel to derive the static acceleration using a
running mean over 2 s [7] and then subtracting this static
acceleration from the raw data [24]. The resulting values for
dynamic acceleration were all then converted to positive values.
These values for DBA were then either summed to provide ODBA

respect to_VV CO2 and the point at which these slopes intersect is
considered to be the gas exchange threshold, which closely
corresponds to the ventilatory threshold [41,cf. 42], the point
which approximately indicates when the participant changes from
aerobic to anaerobic respiration as a main source of energy
production. All data where participants were running at speeds
which suggested that there was considerable anaerobic metabolism
were excluded from the analysis.

Simple linear regressions were used to test the strength of
relationships between ODBA and VeDBA for both humans and
animals. Mixed linear models tested the relationships between data
recorded from the straight mounting and data recorded from the
skewed mounting in the human trials. The coefficient of variation
for ODBA and VeDBA was calculated for each human participant
for the two logger data sets combined. Mixed linear models were
used to generate equations for _VV O2 against the two acceleration
metrics for all participants together,
including participant as a
random factor, separately for the straight- and skew-mounted

logger data. To compare the error on estimates of
ODBA or VeDBA caused by an acceleration logger becoming

terms differs, the precise formulation of them means that larger
VeDBA values will generally also accompany larger ODBA values,
although VeDBA values will almost invariably be lower and never
higher than ODBA. How much higher ODBA is than VeDBA will
depend, inter alia, on the type of motion recorded which, in turn
depends on animal type, gait and tag location. Our study was
limited in scope, incorporating data from only 7 species, all of
which were travelling in a straight line on a treadmill (although
some species exhibited a range of behaviors at slower speeds), so it
is unwise to over-interpret. Nonetheless, the treadmill approach
has been used as a general method to simulate increased activity of
all types by researchers examining the relationship between heart
rate and _VV O2 for many years [e.g. 20,21] and two studies have
explicitly sought to incorporate behaviours other than straight-line
treadmill
locomotion within the treadmill context with success
[38,43]. With these provisos in mind, generally, it is to be expected
that an important finding of this study is the close correlation
between ODBA and VeDBA where no human participant had an r2
of less than 0.998 for mean values derived from either skew or
straight loggers with, unsurprisingly, the slope of the relationship
always being less than 1. In addition, simple comparisons of the
correlations between ODBA and VeDBA with_VV O2 in animals show
that they differ minimally (Table 2). This makes the discussion of
whether ODBA or VeDBA is a better predictor of metabolic rate
[24] rather academic. Nonetheless, given concerns about potential

limb articulating on another is considered (Fig. 6) where muscles
emanating from the upper limb are inserted at various angles (h)
on the lower limb [e.g. 44], each exerting a force (F), then the
overall force along the longitudinal y-axis (Fytot) is given by the
vectorial solution;

The torque (t) along the y-axis produced by the contraction of

force and the pivot point of the articulation so that;

a necessarily non-vectorial derivation, where the energy used
equates directly with the oxygen consumed [45]. Thus, seen from
a pure physics perspective, VeDBA is the proper way to derive the
total magnitude of the acceleration vector at any one moment in
studying
time. However,
energetics is not the total acceleration but how the DBA signal
relates to rate of energy expenditure, and specifically the rate of
energy expenditure used by the muscles involved. The rate of
energy expenditure is not just dependent on the movement arc,
which is described by VeDBA [see 24 for treatment of this], but also
dependent, among other things, on the force exerted by the
contracting muscles at the points of their insertion. A single muscle
can contract to produce a movement arc of one limb by exerting
an appropriate force (Fig. 6) while exactly the same movement arc
can result from the contraction of two or more differently inserted
muscles (Fig. 6), each of which exerts a force that leads to a
vectorial solution that accords with that exhibited by the single
muscle. In both cases the overall result for movement and physical
work done is the same but in the latter case the oxygen consumed
by the multiple muscles will exceed that of the single muscle
because forces are developed that are not equally manifest in the
movement. Fundamental to the amount of oxygen used by a body
is the amount of muscle tissue that is active [46] and the precise
orientation of various muscle groups involved in limb movement is
critical in this regard. Human walking and running is brought
about by a complex interplay of
interacting, and variously
inserted, muscles [44] which, nonetheless, produces a relatively
simple movement arc which equates to the vectorial component of
the variously contracting muscles even though the muscular work
produced may more appropriately be represented by a sum value
of muscular contraction. The ‘inefficiencies’
from
partially opposing contracting muscles are, in fact, necessary for
increasing limb stability [cf. 8]. For example, animals moving over
rough terrain could not afford to have limb movement that is
overly sensitive to lateral forces.

A specific concern, and one that perhaps might lead to the
greatest discrepancy between ODBA and VeDBA, is what happens
when device orientation is not standardized. Importantly, in our
study on humans, the difference in recorded _VV O2 at a speed of
5 km/h compared to_VV O2 estimated for the same speed from the
data recorded by the skew-mounted logger using the calibrations
obtained from the straight-mounted logger was small. Further, it
did not differ between ODBA and VeDBA. Thus, apparently, even
if a logger
then
subsequently slips out of true, perhaps, for example, due to the
intensity of the exercise, both ODBA and VeDBA would appear
similarly powerful proxies for _VV O2. In fact, contrary to what might
treatise, VeDBA did not
be expected from a purely physical
outperform ODBA based on any of statistical analyses conducted.
The actual acceleration values recorded by a straight- with
respect to skew-mounted tri-axial accelerometer can be derived for
any scenario by considering the relative rotations for each of the
axes. Here, the matrix representation for the acceleration vector
transformation is

where a,b and c are the angles of roll, pitch and yaw angles of the
skew-mounted accelerometer relative to the straight-mounted one,
where the rotations are carried out in that order.

Thus, if the acceleration vector measured by the device in the

straight-mounted position is

then in the skew-mounted position, that same acceleration is
measured as a vector;

Derived values for these vector components can be used to
produce VeDBA,
(using Eq 2) which does not change with
orientation and, more particularly, to produce ODBA (using Eq 1)
which does change with orientation (Fig. 7). This approach shows
that under given conditions of triaxial acceleration (the case shown

in Fig. 7 shows equal amounts of dynamic acceleration in the heave
surge and sway axes), deviations of up to 10u in any one axis
produce only up to a 1% change in ODBA (although a 10% change
in two or three axes simultaneously produces about a 1% and
0.03% change in ODBA, respectively). In fact, to produce a 5%
change in ODBA requires skew placement of .20u in one or more
axes, something which would be immediately obvious during many
device attachment protocols. Thus, although many situations where
loggers containing tri-axial accelerometers are attached to animals
for derivation of energy expenditure will not have to worry overly
about orientation [e.g. 47], there are a number of obvious situations,
such as having round, unmarked devices in which the orientation of
the transducers is unclear and placing devices via suction cups onto
whales [48,49] that should only use VeDBA. Importantly though, the
latter situation is also likely to incur substantial additional errors in
any derivation of DBA and its relation to _VV O2 resulting from the
non-standardized positioning of the device on the body relative to
the animal’s centre of gravity, which would markedly affect both
ODBA and VeDBA signals [24]. This effect is apparent even in our
results on humans where, despite placing the straight and skew tag
as closely together as we could, the correlation coefficient between
_VV O2 and VeDBA for straight and skewed tag orientations was

(marginally) different. Allusion to this phenomenon, in an albeit
simplistic form, can be accessed via equation (7) which shows the
extent to which distance from the pivot point (or distance from the
moving body part such as a fish’s tail [24]) affects DBA.

Overall, our results showed that ODBA was insensitive to the
accelerometer when its axes were skewed off the major axes of the
body (by 30u in roll, pitch and yaw), which we attribute to the
general variance between _VV O2 and DBA and the fact that the
degree of skew tested was insufficient to elicit a marked difference in
the way ODBA reacts to changes in orientation. Thus, against
predictions based on physical theory, our study indicates that ODBA
is, in fact, not worse than VeDBA at predicting_VVO2; if anything it is
better (though the difference is minimal) as long as devices can be
attached close to the major axes of the body. This indicates that
whether researchers use ODBA or VeDBA may not be the most
critical issue in treatment of DBA signals and _VV O2 because variation
in device positioning is likely to introduce much more variability
[39]. Future work will have to address this aspect more carefully.
For the moment, researchers should certainly be working towards
positioning their devices in the same anatomical location as far as
possible and, with the exception of a few species such as cetaceans
[47] and animals that have tags implanted [50], this will tend to lead
to device orientation being correct anyway. There are other
particularly germane reasons for researchers to orientate devices on
their study species in a comparable manner. In particular,
it
underpins powerful behaviour identification protocols based on
posture and dynamic acceleration [51], a process which,
itself,
requires device orientation to be controlled rigorously. Subsequent-
ly, both the known behaviour and the ODBA-derived estimate of
metabolic rate can be used to determine activity-specific metabolic
rate. VeDBA would, however, clearly be a better proxy of_VV O2 than
ODBA where device orientation cannot be maintained within a 30u
arc in any of the angular dimensions and so should be used when
loggers cannot be implanted [52] reasonably precisely, or attached
reasonably precisely [50], or are ingested [e.g. 53]. Importantly
though, determination of behaviour using inconsistently placed
accelerometers is more problematic.

Conclusions

The assumption that DBA derived by a vectorial rather than an
absolute summation is more appropriate as a proxy for _VV O2 is not
founded for devices mounted in a standardized manner and issues
of force generation by muscles likely account for this rather than
just the physics associated with measures of acceleration. ODBA
and VeDBA are very closely correlated with each other and both
can be excellent proxies for movement-based metabolic rate.
Proponents of DBA as a proxy of metabolic rate must choose
which derivation to use based on (a) the value they place on the
derivation representing the biology of muscle metabolism (b)
whether they are concerned that logger orientation could vary
markedly (c) whether they wish to compare their DBA values with
values in the literature. Critically, neither ODBA nor VeDBA deals
with the problem of variation in device positioning.
