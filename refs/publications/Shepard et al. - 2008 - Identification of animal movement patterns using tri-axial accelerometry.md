ABSTRACT: An animal’s behaviour is a response to its environment and physiological condition, and
as such, gives vital clues as to its well-being, which is highly relevant in conservation issues. Behav-
iour can generally be typified by body motion and body posture, parameters that are both measurable
using animal-attached accelerometers. Interpretation of acceleration data, however, can be complex,
as  the  static  (indicative  of  posture)  and  dynamic  (motion)  components  are  derived  from  the  total
acceleration values, which should ideally be recorded in all 3-dimensional axes. The principles of tri-
axial accelerometry are summarised and discussed in terms of the commonalities that arise in pat-
terns of acceleration across species that vary in body pattern, life-history strategy, and the medium
they inhabit. Using tri-axial acceleration data from deployments on captive and free-living animals
(n = 12 species), behaviours were identified that varied in complexity, from the rhythmic patterns of
locomotion,  to  feeding,  and  more  variable  patterns  including  those  relating  to  social  interactions.
These data can be combined with positional information to qualify patterns of area-use and map the
distribution of target behaviours. The range and distribution of behaviour may also provide insight
into the transmission of disease. In this way, the measurement of tri-axial acceleration can provide
insight into individual and population level processes, which may ultimately influence the effective-
ness of conservation practice.

INTRODUCTION

An animal’s behaviour is a fundamental part of its bi-
ology, being a manifestation of its response to the envi-
ronment (which, if appropriate, will increase its fitness)
as well as being connected to its physiological condition.
This explains why the study of animal behaviour is so
widespread and complex. Although measures of behav-
iour take many forms (e.g. Martin & Bateson 2007), be-
haviour can be well documented by assessment of move-

ment, or the lack of it, which has been described by var-
ious animal-attached sensors (see Cooke et al. 2004 for
review) including, recently, accelerometers (e.g. Yoda et
al. 1999, Tanaka et al. 2001, Kato et al. 2006). Indeed,
since accelerometers measure both animal orientation
and the dynamics of movement (Yoda et al. 1999), ani-
mal-attached accelerometers can provide data on the oc-
currence of a wide range of behaviours in free-living
organisms which cannot readily be observed (e.g. Watan-
abe et al. 2005, Tsuda et al. 2006, Wilson et al. 2008).

As  a  consequence,  accelerometry  is  a  potentially
powerful tool with which to address an array of conser-
vation  issues  in  higher  vertebrates.  For  instance,
behavioural data could be combined with information
on  animal  location  (Tanaka  et  al.  2001)  to  produce
qualified maps of area-use, identified as a priority by
Amlaner  &  Macdonald  (1980).  Ultimately  this  could
enable  habitat  to  be  delineated  according  to  its  im-
portance for courtship, mating, the rearing of offspring,
or  any  other  behaviour  identifiable  in  the  species  of
interest. This approach could also be used to map the
occurrence  of  particular  behaviours,  including  those,
such as the depredation of livestock, which are often a
source  of  human–wildlife  conflict  (e.g.  Marker  et  al.
2003).  Accelerometry  also  has  the  potential  to  diag-
nose  aberrant  behavioural  patterns,  such  as  those
associated with infection (Hart 1988). These patterns,
whilst of interest per se, could also be combined with
location information to provide insight into the source
of  the  infection  and  the  likelihood  of  transmission
either  within  or  between  species  (e.g.  between  the
Eurasian badger Meles meles and cattle, Carter et al.
2007).  The  spread  of  disease  is  a  central  issue  in  the
conservation  of  many  higher  vertebrates,  particularly
small  populations,  e.g.  those  of  the  Ethiopian  wolf
Canis simensis, which are susceptible to outbreaks of
rabies  following  interactions  with  infected  domestic
dogs (Randall et al. 2006).

Despite the potential power of this technology and its
use in fields such as veterinary and sport science (e.g.
Cavagna et al. 1963, Barrey & Desbrosse 1996), a rela-
tively small number of people currently use accelerom-
etry to investigate animal behaviour, and it has not yet,
to our knowledge, been directly applied to animal con-
servation  issues.  In  addition,  the  majority  of  deploy-
ments have been on aquatic organisms using mono- or
bi-axial accelerometers (e.g. Watanuki et al. 2006, Sato
et  al.  2007).  Acceleration  can  be  measured  in  3  axes
(e.g. Wilson et al. 2008), which should be aspired to for
a  number  of  reasons:  (1)  This  provides  a  measure  of
animal motion in all spatial dimensions, which gives a
more accurate estimate of the animal’s complete body
acceleration  with  corresponding  power  to  identify
types of behaviour. While movement patterns such as
locomotion are generally identifiable and quantifiable
in 1 or 2 acceleration axes, other, rarer, movement pat-
terns may only be identifiable by measuring accelera-
tion  in  3  axes.  (2)  Determination  of  the  combined
dynamic acceleration from 3 axes provides a proxy for
energy  expenditure  (Wilson  et  al.  2006).  (3)  Proper
quantification  of  the  acceleration  experienced  by  an
animal’s body in any axis necessitates that mono- and
bi-axial  accelerometers  be  aligned  perfectly  with  the
horizontal plane; however, where acceleration is mea-
sured in 3 axes, any reduction in measured accelera-

tion in one axis is compensated for in other dimensions,
so that device orientation on the animal is less critical.
Finally,  advances  in  solid-state  technology  mean  that
acceleration  can  now  be  measured  in  the  third  axis
without  increasing  the  size  of  the  transducers  or
recording device.

The  interpretation  of  animal  acceleration  data  is
complex,  however,  as  measured  acceleration  is  the
result of both a static and a dynamic component (e.g.
Sato et al. 2003) and animals can have a large reper-
toire  of  movement  patterns  that  vary  in  duration  and
complexity. The aim of this study is to provide a gen-
eral  framework  whereby  the  identification  of  move-
ment patterns, as recorded by tri-axial accelerometers,
could  be  simplified  across  animals  of  different  body
patterns  and  life-histories.  Specifically,  we  seek  to
summarise the main principles of accelerometry, from
the recorded data to initial transformations, and exam-
ine the potential of these outputs to offer insight into a
range  of  biological  questions.  To  this  end,  a  range  of
animals  of  varying  size  and  body  patterns  were
equipped  with  tri-axial  accelerometers.  A  subset  of
these animals was then observed in order to describe
the  accelerometric  signals  coding  for  the  movement
patterns recorded.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Acceleration was recorded in 3 axes corresponding
to  the  dorso–ventral,  anterior–posterior  and  lateral
axes (hereafter referred to as heave, surge and sway,
which denotes the dynamic component in each respec-
tive  axis)  using  experimental  ‘daily  diary’  (DD)  units
(Wilson  et  al.  2008).  The  DD  circuitry  was  potted  in
epoxy  resin  (Atlas  Polymers)  and  given  a  hydro-
dynamic shape. Units could record on up to 13 chan-
nels  and  included  transducers  for  magnetic  field
strength  in  3  axes,  pressure,  light  and  temperature;
however,  only  the  acceleration  data  are  referred  to
here. Acceleration values are given in g, where g rep-
resents acceleration due to gravity (1 g = 9.81 m s–2).
Tri-axial  acceleration  data  were  recorded  with  22-bit
resolution in a 128 Mb flash RA memory with an accu-
racy of ± 0.06 g. The units were programmed to record
at up to 32 Hz using Terminal Freeware, and data were
analysed  using  Origin  Pro  (OriginLab)  and  Microsoft
Excel (Microsoft Corporation). A total of 12 animal spe-
cies was instrumented with tri-axial accelerometers in
both  wild  and  captive  conditions  (Table  1);  details  of
deployment are given below.

Field  deployments. The  recording  devices  used  in
field deployments were potted in resin, weighed 42 g
in air and a maximum of 12 g in water, and had maxi-
mum dimensions of 55 × 30 × 15 mm unless otherwise

stated.  Imperial  cormorants  Phalacrocorax  atriceps,
with a mean body mass of 2.1 kg (Svagelj & Quintana
2007),  were  the  smallest  species  equipped — as  such,
the device represented an average 2% of the animal’s
mass in air.

Thirty-three imperial cormorants were instrumented
in Punta León, Argentina (Table 1) in December 2005
and 2006, using a custom-made crook to remove birds
from the nests where they were brooding chicks. The
devices  were  attached  to  the  lower  back  using  Tesa
tape (Wilson et al. 1997) before birds were returned to
their nests, where they continued brooding. The whole
procedure took < 5 min. Twenty-one Magellanic pen-
guins  Spheniscus  magellanicus were  caught  and
equipped  with  a  DD  in  Puerto  Deseado,  Argentina
(Table 1), during December 2005 and 2006, using Tesa
tape to attach the units, and the handling method out-
lined  in  Wilson  et  al.  (1997).  These  birds  were  also
brooding  small  chicks  and  were  returned  to  the  nest
after < 5 min of handling time. Birds from both species
were  allowed  to  forage  for  a  single  trip  before  the
devices were retrieved.

Three Eurasian badgers Meles meles were equipped
with data loggers in Wytham Woods, UK (2004), after
being  trapped  and  sedated  following  the  methods
specified  by  Macdonald  &  Newman  (2002).  The  DD
was  attached  to  a  leather  collar  using  duct  tape  and
fastened round the animals’ necks. The procedure took
ca. 5 min. The badger was released following recovery
from  the  sedative  and  recaptured  after  2  to  95  d  to
retrieve the devices.

Four  female  leatherback  turtles  Dermochelys  cori-
acea were equipped with DDs at St Croix, Caribbean
(Table 1), during the inter-nesting period in May 2007.
Individuals were equipped and devices were retrieved
when  turtles  exited  the  water  to  lay  eggs.  Loggers
(dimensions  120  × 20  × 35  mm,  mass  90  g)  were

attached directly to the central dorsal ridge of the cara-
pace  (Fossette  et  al.  2008)  by  feeding  2  mm,  coated
stainless  steel  wire  through  2  holes  in  the  ridge,  ca.
6 cm  apart,  and  crimping  them  together  into  2  loops
around the device and its base. The base of the device
was constructed from Platinum Silicone Putty (Equinox
TM  Series;  <www.smooth-on.com>)  to  form  a  stream-
lined and snug fit to the top of the central ridge of the
animal. Deployment lasted from 4.5 h to 7.3 d.

Captive deployments. Deployments on captive ani-
mals were mainly made in Buenos Aires Zoo, Argen-
tina  (Table  1),  during  May  2007,  using  resin-potted
devices  measuring  65  × 36  × 15  mm,  mass  21  g.  The
smallest  animal  to  be  instrumented  was  a  hairy
armadillo  Chaetophractus  villosus,  which  had  a  body
mass  of  2.98  kg  and  where  the  device  represented
0.7% of the animal’s mass. Animals were captured and
restrained by the zoo keepers, without sedative, with
a handling time of less than ca. 6 min for any individ-
ual. A vet was present during the capture of each ani-
mal. Devices were attached for relatively short periods
of  time  (77  to  126  min,  mean  110  min)  during  which
time the animals were released into their pens, where
they  were  observed,  and  patterns  of  movement  and
behaviour were recorded.

Nominally, devices were attached using a collar con-
structed  from  Silastic  P1®.  Silastic  is  a  highly  elastic,
soft, hypoallergenic 2-part silicone-based rubber (Dow
Corning;  UK  supplier:  W.  P.  Notcutt,  Ripley),  which
was  poured  into  a  mould  to  create  strips,  ca.  3  mm
thick at their widest point, which could be cut to appro-
priate lengths and fastened around the animal’s neck
with a cable tie so that they were fitted flush against
the  skin.  The  device  was  attached  to  the  collar  using
Tesa tape and was positioned on the ventral side of the
animal’s neck. The animals showed no signs of discom-
fort due to the attachment of the device apart from the

50

Endang Species Res 10: 47–60

Brazilian tapir, which shook its head sporadically, pos-
sibly  in  response  to  the  position  of  the  Silastic  collar,
which was wrapped over its head in an effort to keep
the  device  dry.  Otherwise,  a  single  device  was
attached  to  a  female  hairy  armadillo  Chaetophractus
villosus using Tesa tape to secure it to the armour just
behind the back of the neck, and a single device was
also attached to a male mouflon Ovis musimon using a
leather collar.

Devices were also deployed in April 2007 on 5 semi-
tame cheetahs Acinonyx jubatus in rehabilitation facil-
ities at Africat, Otjiwarongo, Namibia, and at Harnas,
Gobabis,  Namibia.  Four  deployments  were  made  at
Africat; 2 on habituated animals without the need for
sedative,  and  2  on  unhabituated  animals  that  were
captured with a dart rifle with a combined dose of Zo-
latil and Medetomidine, and recaptured using a dose
of Ketamine. Devices were attached to leather collars,
and instrumented animals were allowed to roam freely
in large enclosures (400 and 4000 ha at Africat) for the
duration of the deployment (range 4 to 7 d).

Two  lemon  sharks  Negaprion  brevirostris,  of  total
lengths 186 and 150 cm, were captured in April 2006
off  Bimini  Island,  Bahamas  (Table  1).  Animals  were
captured  using  sport-fishing  gear  with  Mustad  shark
size 10 circle hooks baited with live bait from a small
skiff,  while  the  water  was  chummed.  Once  captured,
the sharks were transported in large water containers
onboard the boat, to an oval pen (ca. 20  × 5 m) situated
within  an  otherwise  open  lagoon,  where  the  animals
were left to rest for a minimum of 2 d before trials com-
menced.  Each  shark  was  instrumented  by  guiding  it
into a polyurethane sling using a hand-held seine-net
and  large  wooden  boards,  where  the  devices  were
attached (dimensions 90 × 32 × 20 mm, mass 60 g in air)
by passing 2 sections of monofilament line through the
device  and  the  dorsal  fin.  After  periods  of  2  and  4  d,
respectively, subjects were recaptured using the same
method  as  that  preceding  instrumentation  and  the
device was removed by cutting the monofilament with
wire cutters prior to the sharks being released.

Analysis. Dynamic  acceleration  was  derived  in  the
Magellanic penguin data by taking a running mean of
total acceleration values over 2 s (Wilson et al. 2006).
All other manipulations are described below.

Total acceleration values in one channel were found
to contain system noise for deployments on the guana-
cos  and  leatherback  turtles.  Increases  in  acceleration
that did not accord with changes in acceleration due to
body motion were removed from these channels, iden-
tified  as  data  points  > 0.4  g different  to  the  previous
data point in the channel measuring sway acceleration
in  the  guanaco,  and  data  points  differing  by  > 0.2  g
from the previous data point in the channel measuring
surge acceleration in the leatherback turtle data.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Total  acceleration  values,  that  is,  the  raw  accelera-
tion  values  recorded  in  each  acceleration  channel,
include both a static and dynamic component that can
be  used  to  determine  animal  posture  and  movement.
The following sections describe how these data can be
used separately and in tandem to recreate movement
patterns, either as a descriptive exercise (for instance,
where  the  pattern  has  not  been  previously  docu-
mented),  or  to  ascribe  a  possible  function  where  the
movements  are  consistent  with  a  known  behaviour.
The  biomechanical  processes  underlying  movements
such  as  locomotion  are  described  extensively  else-
where  (e.g.  Alexander  1983,  Schmidt-Nielsen  1997)
and are alluded to here in the context of the associated
patterns  in  acceleration  and  their  relevance  to  the
identification  and  study  of  animal  behaviour.  The
power  to  resolve  such  patterns  may  depend  on  both
the sampling frequency and the method used to attach
the  device  to  the  animal  because  loose  attachments,
such as some collar fittings, will generate noise as the
animal moves.

Static acceleration

Static acceleration is a measure of the incline of the
accelerometer with respect to the earth’s gravitational
field  and  therefore  provides  a  measure  of  the  body
angle  of  the  instrumented  animal.  Static  acceleration
measured  in  3  axes  enables  the  calculation  of  body
pitch  and  roll  (Wilson  et  al.  2008,  their Fig.  5b).  The
pitch is calculated as the arcsine of g, where g is the
static  acceleration  in  the  heave  channel.  The  roll  is
derived in the same way from the static acceleration in
the sway axis. Static acceleration ranges from 1 to –1 g
in each channel, each sensor recording its maximum of
1  g when  facing  upwards,  directly  away  from  the
earth’s gravitational field (e.g. Fig. 1a).

The  sensitivity  with  which  the  device  measures
changes in pitch will vary with device angle because
body angle is an arcsine function of the static compo-
nent (Fig. 1). Pitch can be derived from both the surge
and  heave,  and  in  an  upright,  stationary  animal,  the
heave measures 1 g and the surge 0 g. If, however, the
animal rotates forward by 40° for example, the change
in g from the channel measuring surge (given as y in
Fig.  1a)  becomes  proportionately  greater  than  that
measured by the heave (given as x in Fig. 1a) due to
the changing function of the arcsine of the measured g.
Generally,  the  surge  is  more  sensitive  to  changes  in
pitch at body angles of 0 to 45° and 135 to 180° (Fig. 1b)
and  the  heave  more  sensitive  to  changes  in  pitch  at
body angles of 45 to 135° (Fig. 1b).

angle for channels measuring heave and surge. Position of the
device shown above the graph. In initial position, static accel-
eration  in  the  heave  axis  is  shown  as  (–f–f–),  and  surge  as
(–––). After movement of the device through some 40°, shown
by the dashed line, the change in surge (y) is greater than the
change in heave (x). (b) Rate of change in static acceleration
(in g per degree movement) in both heave (–f–f–) and surge
(–––) is plotted against body angle, where lines above the hor-
izontal  dashed  line  indicate  when  each  of  the  axes  is  most
sensitive to changes in body angle pitch

Since  pitch  is  derived  from  the  static  acceleration,
this  component  needs  to  be  derived  from  the  total
acceleration,  which  includes  both  static  and  dynamic
acceleration.  Static  acceleration  may  be  derived  by
subjecting the total acceleration to an appropriate pass
filter (e.g. Tanaka et al. 2001, Watanuki et al. 2005) or,
as for this work, by smoothing (Yoda et al. 2001, Wilson
et al. 2008) before converting the resultant value into
degrees using the arcsine function (Fig. 2a). It is thus
possible  to  estimate  the  approximate  body  pitch  and
roll angle of animals by simple visual inspection of the
total  acceleration  data  (Fig.  2a),  assuming  that  the
device  is  aligned  perfectly  with  the  horizontal  plane.
We note that imperfect orientation of the device on the
animal  will  result  in  pitch  angles  offset  from  the  ani-

mal’s longitudinal axis to a corresponding degree. We
refer to such deviations as the ‘device angle’ (following
notation  by  Watanuki  et  al.  2003).  This  device  angle
must be accounted for in the calculation of real animal
pitch,  and  can  be  best  calculated  when  the  animal  is
either horizontal or perpendicular, as recorded during
instrumentation  or  when  the  animal  is  ranging  freely
(Watanuki et al. 2003). If the method of device attach-
ment  allows  for  some  movement,  e.g.  if  the  device  is
attached using a leather collar, the device angle may
change  during  the  deployment  and  need  re-calibrat-
ing.  For  simplicity,  in  further  discussion  of  predicted
static  values  it  is  assumed  that  the  device  angle  is
equal to 0°.

The  identification  of  body  pitch  and  roll  is  an  im-
portant  step  in  the  classification  of  animal  movement
patterns  (Watanabe  et  al.  2005)  as  any  body  posture
will  narrow  the  range  of  possible  behaviours  or  be
characteristic of one behavioural pattern for the study
animal in question. In the first instance, body posture
can be useful at a broad scale. For instance, a penguin
that is upright for minutes or hours can only be on land,
whereas  a  penguin  in  a  horizontal  position  can  be
either on land (in which case it is likely to be resting) or
in  water  (and  therefore  swimming),  Fig.  2a (see  also
Ropert-Coudert  et  al.  2006).  An  upright  posture  in  a
meerkat  Suricata  suricatta,  however,  is  indicative  of
vigilant  behaviour  (Clutton-Brock  et  al.  1999)  and
would  therefore  record  variance  in  vigilance  through
time, whereas in felids, an upright posture is likely to
occur  against  a  support,  for  instance  during  climbing
or  claw  sharpening  (e.g.  Watanabe  et  al.  2005).  For
many mammals, maintaining a position on their back
or side is likely to be indicative of rest or sleep (Fig. 2b).
Postural  data  can  therefore  be  used  to  determine  the
amount  of  time  an  animal  rested,  even  while  under-
ground, when the relative activity of animals such as
badgers is unknown, or whether the proportion of rest
is  unusually  high,  such  as  may  be  symptomatic  of
infection (Hart 1988).

Cognisance  of  the  length  of  time  that  a  particular
body posture is adopted is also important as, over short
intervals, body posture sequences can be indicative of
behavioural  patterns.  For  instance,  during  a  dive,  an
air-breathing  vertebrate  has  a  characteristic  angle  of
descent  (according  to  dive  depth,  e.g.  Wilson  et  al.
1996), after which there may be a bottom phase and as-
sociated horizontal posture (e.g. in imperial cormorants,
Gómez  Laich  2008,  this  Theme  Section)  before  the
body is pointed toward the surface for the ascent (e.g.
Wilson  et  al.  1996).  In  Magellanic  penguins  this  se-
quence may take up to 276 s (Walker & Boersma 2003).
Other,  more  transient  behaviours  may  also  involve  a
conserved  sequence  of  body  postures,  such  as  the
scent-marking squat in badgers (Buesching & Macdon-

ald 2004). Other parameters include the range of angles
through which the animal move, the speed of change
and/or  the  presence  of  repetition  or  rhythm  in  the
changes. Changes in posture may occur in one or both
planes, for instance a leatherback turtle Dermochelys
coriacea rolled  repeatedly  180° to  one  side  and  then
180° to  the  other  (Fig.  2c),  a  pattern  that  almost  de-
scribes  a  barrel  roll  (and  distinguished  from  it  by
changes in the heave axis, which did not show a contin-
uous  rotation  in  one  direction).  In  this  case,  dramatic
changes in body posture occurred with little dynamic
acceleration, so the behaviour could only be identified
using the static component of acceleration. Movement
also occurs with little dynamic acceleration during glid-
ing and soaring flight (cf. Pennycuik 1972) as well as in
aquatic animals, where gliding occurs during dive de-
scents in negatively buoyant species such as flounders
(Kawabe et al. 2003a) and in dive ascents in positively
buoyant species (Sato et al. 2002). While passive dive
descents  are  likely  to  be  characterised  by  particular
body angles, others, notably dynamic soaring, are char-
acterised by sequential changes in body posture (Nel-
son 1980, and see Wilson et al. 2008, their Fig. 7).

While  static  acceleration  can  characterise  some
behaviours,  animals  often  have  1  or  2  predominant
postures,  such  as  the  horizontal  stance  in  tetrapod
mammals, during which a diverse range of behaviours
are performed. In such cases, beyond static accelera-
tion,  patterns  of  dynamic  acceleration  can  provide
detailed  information  to  help  identify  these  behaviour
patterns.

Dynamic acceleration

Locomotion

The dynamic component of total acceleration repre-
sents the change in velocity as a result of body motion.
It can be derived in its simplest form by subtracting the
static  acceleration  values  (attained,  for  example,  via
smoothing) from the total acceleration values over this
time period (Wilson et al. 2006). According to Newton’s
third law, which states that for every action there is an
equal and opposite reaction, the movement of a limb in
one  direction  will  produce  an  opposite  movement  in
the trunk. This is apparent in repetitive movement pat-
terns during locomotion (Fig. 3), where the movement
of a limb during a power stroke results in a movement
of the body in the other direction. For instance, a wing-
stroke  downwards  (movement  in  the  heave  axis)  will
result in an acceleration (and therefore movement) of
the body upwards (Fig. 3a) (cf. Kato et al. 2006), the lat-
eral motion of a fish tail in one direction will move the
body  in  the  other  (Fig.  3b)  (cf.  Kawabe  et  al.  2003b),

Fig.  3.  Schematic  changes  in  dynamic  acceleration  arising
from  locomotive  limb  movements  in  3  different  axes:  (a)
heave,  as  expected  during  flapping  flight,  (b)  sway  during
carangiform  swimming,  and  (c)  surge  during  bipedal  walk-
ing.  Block  arrows  on  the  animals  indicate  the  direction  of
body  movement,  while  the  single  line  arrows  show  the
direction of limb movement. In  (b) the 2 parts of the stroke
cycle  are  indicated  as  (i)  and  (ii),  whereas  in  (c)  one  full
stroke cycle is shown as (i)

and  the  movement  of  a  limb  backwards  against  the
substrate will propel the body forwards (Fig. 3c). Note
that in fish, whether the measured acceleration in the
trunk is opposed to that of the tail will depend largely
on the position of the recording device.

Oscillations in dynamic acceleration are characteris-
tic of locomotion across animals of different body pat-
terns (Fig. 4). At points of zero dynamic acceleration,
the total acceleration is equal to the static acceleration.
When  dynamic  acceleration  is  a  component  of  total
acceleration,  changes  in  dynamic  acceleration  are
recorded in relation to the static value and, therefore,
both  increasingly  positive  and  increasingly  negative
values of g can represent an increase in dynamic accel-

eration.  For  instance,  in  a  carangiform  swimmer  the
value  of  sway  will  be  zero  at  rest.  Each  stroke  cycle
includes 2 power-strokes as the tail moves first to one
side and then the other (Fig. 3b – i and ii, respectively,
Fig. 4f). The first tail movement causes an increase in
sway acceleration, which is followed by a momentary
decrease  (Fig.  3b – i)  before  sway  acceleration  is  pro-
duced  by  the  tail  moving  in  the  opposite  direction
(Fig. 3b –  ii),  which  then  also  subsides  (Ogilvy  &
Dubois 1981, Kawabe et al. 2003b). Here, the negative
acceleration stemming from the second tail movement
is a reflection of the output of the sway transducer and
is  only  negative  with  respect  to  the  direction  of  the
acceleration produced during the first tail movement.
In  contrast,  increases  in  surge  acceleration  occur
mainly  in  a  forward  direction  and  are  therefore
recorded in one direction from the static acceleration
value,  as  is  apparent  in  heave  acceleration  during
walking (Figs. 3c & 4a,b) and described for the propul-
sive underwater kicks of a cormorant (Kato et al. 2006).
These 2 contrasting patterns are evident in the acceler-
ation  signal  from  a  walking  penguin  (Fig.  4e),  where
values of sway show peaks above and below a mean of
zero,  but  both  these  peaks  are  represented  by
increases in surge from a baseline of zero.

The ability to identify locomotion has broad ecologi-
cal  applications.  For  instance,  temporal  patterns  in
locomotion can provide insight into changes in behav-
ioural  rhythms  such  as  are  seen  during  the  onset  of
migration (Tanaka et al. 2001, Bolger et al. 2008), and
in  response  to  environmental  change  (Tsuda  et  al.
2006). The proportion of time an individual spends in
locomotion can also provide important insights into the
way it uses its environment, for instance, the distance
and effort required to access a particular resource. The
extent of locomotion can provide a measure of distance
moved when stride frequency is combined with stride
length (Alexander 1983). The need to travel further or
search for longer, in order to feed or provision young,
may give an early indication that individuals are under
environmental  stress  (Gremillet  et  al.  2006).  Such
information may not be available from positional data
alone,  for  instance,  in  animals  that  also  move  in  the
vertical dimension. The relative efficiency of resource
acquisition  is  also  affected  by  the  effort  invested  in
locomotion  per  unit  time.  Animal-borne  accelerome-
ters are well-placed to measure this, as the combined
dynamic acceleration from 3 axes, known as the over-
all  dynamic  body  acceleration  (ODBA),  has  been
shown to correlate well with energy expenditure in a
range of species (Wilson et al. 2006, 2008, Halsey et al.
in  press).  Information  on  effort  can  also  be  gleaned
from the gait and relative speed at which individuals
travel,  and  these  parameters  are  also  identifiable  in
acceleration data, as discussed below.

Although relatively complex techniques such as the
fast  Fourier  transform  (e.g.  Watanabe  et  al.  2005),
band-pass filters and shape analysis (Schreer & Testa
1995) can be applied to describe these patterns, simple
rules define expected patterns across and within spe-
cies  (Table  2).  Generally,  the  axis  in  which  the  limbs
move shows the largest variation in acceleration, this
equating  predominantly  to  either  heave  or  sway
(Table 1).  Acceleration  in  the  surge  axis  will  tend  to
show  smaller  fluctuations  even  where  limbs  move  in
this axis (e.g. during walking) as it is more efficient to
travel  at  a  relatively  constant  velocity,  with  minimal
deceleration between power strokes (Schmidt-Nielsen
1997). A switch from one predominant axis to another
typifies  a  change  in  the  type  of  locomotion.  For
instance,  walking  in  a  cormorant  is  characterised  by
oscillations around 0 g in the sway (similar to the pat-
tern  shown  by  walking  penguins;  Fig.  4e),  whereas
flight is typified by oscillations in the heave around a
mean of 1 g (Fig. 4c, see also Gómez Laich 2008). Dur-
ing terrestrial tetrapod locomotion, the heave axis may
show regular acceleration ‘spikes’ caused by the ani-
mal pushing against a hard substrate, as can be seen
during a giant ant-eater walking (Fig. 4b).

Similarities  in  acceleration  arising  from  locomotion
between  animals  with  comparable  body  patterns  are
expected. In the tetrapod mammals equipped, walking
was typified by the strongest changes in acceleration
in  the  heave  axis  (cf.  above),  with  increases  from  a
baseline value of 1 g (Fig. 5). Typically, each peak in
heave had a slight dip in it, giving a characteristic ‘m’

shape, more evident at higher speeds (Fig. 6). Rhyth-
mic peaks were also evident in the surge, with 2 peaks
for every increase in heave (Fig. 5), but less clear in the
sway  axis.  These  types  of  similarities  in  patterns  of
acceleration  across  species  with  different  body  types
and  gaits  (e.g.  knuckle-walking  in  the  giant  anteater
versus digitigrade quadrupedalism) may aid the devel-
opment of automated pattern-recognition, and the use
of patterns known in one species, for the recognition of
those as yet not described in others, particularly where
the undescribed species has a body plan that conforms
roughly to that of a described animal.

Dynamic  acceleration  also  changes  substantially
with changes in patterns of locomotion within individ-
uals. Here, an increase in the frequency and/or ampli-
tude  of  changes  in  acceleration  is  indicative  of  an
increase in effort and usually, speed (Alexander 1983).
Accelerometers may therefore provide a good estimate
of  an  animal’s  speed  of  locomotion,  through  the  fre-
quency (e.g. Herren et al. 1999, Kawabe et al. 2003b),
amplitude and pattern of changes in locomotion in 1 or
2  axes,  or  the  combined  dynamic  acceleration  from  3
axes,  which  predict  speed  accurately  in  humans
(Halsey et al. in press). An animal’s speed of movement
is  a  difficult  parameter  to  measure  (Ponganis  et  al.
1990, Sato et al. 2007, Shepard et al. 2008), particularly
in  terrestrial  species  (Jedrzejewski  et  al.  2001).
Nonetheless,  it  is  a  key  variable  modulating  animal
behaviour, as it is a strong determinant of an animal’s
energy  expenditure  (Taylor  et  al.  1982,  Schmidt-
Nielsen 1997), particularly in the aquatic environment,

where energy expenditure increases as an exponential
function of speed (e.g. Culik et al. 1994).

Changes  in  the  frequency  and  amplitude  patterns
seen in accelerometric signals may be accompanied by
an identifiable change in gait (Zijlstra 2004, Watanabe
et al. 2005). For instance, a llama increasing its speed
from walking to running showed changes in stride fre-
quency  from  1.63  to  1.78  to  1.75  strides  per  second
(Fig. 6).  The  decrease  in  stride  frequency  (following
the  initial  increase)  reflected  a  change  in  gait  as  the
animal started cantering (as noted during concomitant
observations), which is associated with an increase in
stride length as well as acceleration per stride (Alexan-
der 1983). The pattern of acceleration per stroke cycle
also changed as the effort increased: the acceleration
resembled  a  smooth  sine  wave  during  walking,  with
the  waveforms  in  all  axes  having  the  same  period
(Fig. 6),  but  as  effort  increased,  the  amplitude  of  the
peaks in acceleration and the frequency of the strokes
increased, and the pattern of acceleration in the sway
axis became desynchronised with the other 2 axes. A
small  decrease  also  appeared  in  the  middle  of  each
acceleration  peak  in  the  heave  and  surge  (Fig.  6),
likely to represent the movement of 2 pairs of legs in
unison per stride, which is the 2-beat gait characteris-
tic of trotting (Alexander 1984). As the llama increased
its  speed  further,  each  main  peak  was  followed  by  a
subsidiary peak, which may reflect the ‘3-beat gait’ of
cantering in camelids (Alexander 1984). Here, patterns
of  acceleration  in  all  3  dimensions  changed  with  the
animal’s  gait.  Such  changes  can  form  the  basis  for
quantifiable  classification  of  different  movement  pat-
terns  where  conserved  across  individuals  (e.g.  Tsuda
et al. 2006).

The effort associated with movement can provide a
measure  of  the  animals’  motivation  and  therefore

insight  into  the  function  of  a  movement  pattern.  For
instance, animals are expected to travel at a speed that
minimizes the cost of transport (e.g. Culik et al. 1994),
which  is  likely  to  correspond  to  the  predominant  fre-
quency  in  acceleration  data  through  time  (Sato  et  al.
2007). Lower frequencies will arise when the purpose
of  locomotion  is  not  to  minimize  net  energy  used  per
unit  distance  travelled,  e.g.  optimizing  food  intake
while  grazing.  Higher  frequencies  and  amplitudes
occur when an animal is being pursued or in pursuit of
another (Wilson et al. 2002). Behaviours with motiva-
tion more complex than the minimization of the cost of
transport are likely to be identifiable by further charac-
teristics in acceleration data.

Movement other than locomotion

The identification of movement patterns from behav-
iours other than locomotion is more complex, and more
likely to involve patterns of acceleration in all 3 axes,
yet  the  principles  remain  the  same.  Identifying  the
diversity of an animal’s behaviours could be important,
for instance, where a lack of variability is a diagnostic
feature  of  infection  (Hart  1988),  or  symptomatic  of
resource absence. There is the potential to identify any
pattern of behaviour where it is represented by a con-
served  posture  and/or  motion.  Less  common  behav-
iours  may  also  be  identified  by  their  position  in  a
sequence of known behavioural patterns. For instance,
in rutting male mountain goats, a mutual clash/head-
butt  is  preceded  by  a  run-up  or  charge  (McClelland
1991),  which  is  manifest  as  a  run  followed  by  abrupt
peaks in all acceleration axes indicating a substantial
impact (cf. our  Fig. 7, and compare to the impact expe-

shown in Fig. 7, the impact of the head-butt was likely
to  be  much  greater  than  that  recorded,  with  some  of
the impact being absorbed by specially-adapted tissue
in  the  head  (Currey  1984)  dissipated  along  both  the
neck  and  the  collar  attachment  of  the  device,  which
was not tight against the animals’ skin.

In  practice,  the  static  and  dynamic  components  are
likely to be interpreted in tandem, with one component
being  used  to  contextualise  the  other  (Fig.  8).  For  in-
stance, for grazing herbivores, including many ungu-
lates and camelids, body posture is indicative of feed-
ing  behaviour,  with  head  down  during  ingestion  and
head  up  during  mastication  and  when  moving
between food patches. Such patterns can be identified
in acceleration traces, particularly where the device is
attached to a collar and therefore sensitive to changes
in position of the neck (Fig. 8a,b), and could enable the
quantification of the time allocated to ingestion. Feed-
ing  may  also  be  identified  in  other  animals,  as  prey
capture  attempts  often  form  part  of  a  relatively  con-
served  behavioural  sequence,  such  as  predators  that
pursue prey (Fig. 9) (Watanabe et al. 2005). Prey han-
dling may also be identifiable to confirm when chases
were successful. A diverse range of behaviours could
be  identified  through  the  combination  of  static  and
dynamic  elements;  for  instance,  washing  behaviour
was apparent in a cormorant as brief bouts of flapping
with  the  bird  in  a  horizontal  posture,  followed  by  a
‘ducking’ change in posture before the end of the bout
(Fig. 8c,d). Digging and shaking are also likely to pro-
duce distinctive acceleration patterns. Software is cur-
rently being constructed that enables the visualisation
of body posture and motion, as measured on the instru-
mented animal, to facilitate the identification of behav-
iours,  even  those  as  yet  undescribed.  The  scale  at
which behaviour can be recognised (either visually or
through  the  use  of  pattern  recognition  software)  is
likely to be improved by the combination of accelera-
tion  signals  with  visual  observations.  This  may  ulti-
mately enable researchers to distinguish patterns such
as those associated with the selection of food type, thus
enabling  the  calculation  of  net  energy  gain  per  unit
time, even in taxa with characteristically variable diets.
In summary, animal-attached accelerometers can be
used to identify a wide range of behaviour patterns by
providing  quantitative  data  on  body  posture  and
motion. This yields data on the occurrence and intensi-
ties of behaviour with excellent resolution. Clues to the
possible function of such behaviour patterns may also
be  available  from  the  time  they  occurred  or  the
sequence  of  behavioural  changes.  Furthermore,  such
data  may  be  used  to  allude  to  activity-specific  meta-
bolic  rate,  where  recorded  in  3  axes.  This  requires  a

Such information can be used in specific conservation

individuals
monitoring  behaviour  of  captive-bred
