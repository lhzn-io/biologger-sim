Large predators frequent the open ocean where subsurface light drives visually based trophic interactions.
However, we lack knowledge on how predators achieve energy balance in the unproductive open ocean
where prey biomass is minimal in well-lit surface waters but high in dim midwaters in the form of scattering
layers. We use an interdisciplinary approach to assess how the bioenergetics of scattering layer forays by a
model predator vary across biomes. We show that the mean metabolic cost rate of daytime deep foraging
dives to scattering layers decreases as much as 26% from coastal to pelagic biomes. The more favorable ener-
getics offshore are enabled by the addition of a shallow scattering layer that, if not present, would otherwise
necessitate costlier dives to deeper layers. The unprecedented importance of this shallow scattering layer chal-
lenges assumptions that the globally ubiquitous primary deep scattering layer constitutes the only mesopelagic
resource regularly targeted by apex predators.

INTRODUCTION
In the deep open ocean, the greater relative productivity of pelagic
than benthic energy pathways favors the dominance of large pelagic
predatory fishes over demersal counterparts (1, 2). These pelagic
predators exhibit the highest metabolic demand known among
marine fishes as a result of intense selection for the capacity to ac-
tively and visually pursue mobile prey in offshore waters (3), in
some cases yielding the phenotypic extreme of endothermy (4).
The foraging environment of highly migratory pelagic predators
constitutes a dynamic energy seascape of movement costs and ben-
efits that shift across space and time to determine energetic profit-
ability; this, in turn, structures predator selection of habitats and
their directed movements among them (5). Notably, predators
with high energy expenditure typically target prey with greater en-
ergetic content (6) and feed in areas with minimized energetic costs
(7), thereby increasing net energetic profit. The similarity in move-
ment patterns across diverse predator lineages, as well as their
change from coastal to open ocean regions (8), is consistent with
altering foraging strategies in response to a variable energy seascape
(9). Coastal regions exhibit seasonal peaks in primary productivity
that can lead to predator occurrence tracking temporary resource
waves (10). In comparison, while much of the open ocean is consis-
tently characterized by low prey biomass in well-lit near-surface
waters during the day but high prey biomass in dim midwaters
(11), distributional characteristics of deep resources govern
whether large pelagic predators surpass the threshold of energetic
viability in unproductive waters (12).

The ocean twilight zone harbors the greatest biomass of animals
on the planet, the fishes alone of which are estimated to constitute in
excess of 11 billion (metric) tons (13). Some of these organisms

form dense aggregations that are readily detectable with scientific
echosounders as acoustic scattering layers (14). The vertical distri-
butions of these layers are bounded within distinct ranges of light
intensities that govern tradeoffs in predation risk and foraging op-
portunity (15). The largest and most researched is the primary deep
scattering layer (DSL) prevalent throughout the world ocean at a
mean depth of ∼500 m and covering a vertical extent of >200 m
(16, 17). While the daytime occurrence of a single DSL is commonly
observed, multiple scattering layers comprising different communi-
ties may be present and vary in number across a range of spatial and
temporal scales (18, 19, 20). Depending on the region in the ocean,
∼20 to 95% of scattering layer organisms may undergo diel vertical
migration in which they occupy mesopelagic depths during the day
and epipelagic depths at night; the remaining portion is nonmigrant
and maintains a largely constant mesopelagic depth distribution
across the diel cycle (16).

There is increasingly more documentation of surface–to–deep
ocean connectivity driven by pelagic predators foraging on abun-
dant scattering layer prey or other organisms associated with
these layers (21). For example, oceanographic features that harbor
more scattering layer biomass (22) aggregate diverse pelagic preda-
tors (23), highlighting that environmental variability influences the
trophic connectivity between predators and scattering layer prey
(24). This connectivity between scattering layers and predators is
complex, as oceanography affects both the prey and predators.
Light penetration is a major determinant of scattering layer depth
(25), while other extrinsic factors, such as temperature or oxygen,
interact with physiological constraints to determine what depths
predators may occupy and, thus, which specific layer(s) they may
target (26). However, we lack knowledge on how predators
achieve energy balance in the open ocean, including the cost of
deep diving and changes in metabolic rate while targeting scattering
layers across biomes with varying light and physiologically relevant
conditions at depth. Accounting for environmental influence on
metabolic rate is necessary to understand the bioenergetic tradeoffs
that structure predator behavior and trophic linkages to prey (27).
Given that vast swaths of the open ocean have long been considered

a marine desert (28), these bioenergetic considerations are crucial to
understanding the seasonal, age-specific, or lifelong persistence of
predators in seemingly nutrient-poor biomes.

Here, we use data from archival tags deployed on a model pelagic
predator, albacore tuna (Thunnus alalunga), to assess how the bio-
energetics of scattering layer forays vary across North Pacific
biomes. Tag-measured depth and relative light levels permit us to
reconstruct the subsurface light attenuation environment experi-
enced by the predators, including increased attenuation putatively
caused by chlorophyll maxima in the euphotic zone and scattering
layers below. With a bioenergetics model of total metabolic rate as a
function of vertical swimming speed and in situ water temperature,
we estimate the energetic cost of deep diving to scattering layers
across oligotrophic to mesotrophic and subtropical to temperate
waters. In concert, these analyses enable us to assess how the specific
scattering layer that a thermally limited predator targets may tran-
sition across oceanographic regimes with differing energy
seascapes.

RESULTS
Migration
Archival tags were deployed on juvenile albacore (n = 1086 individ-
uals) in the Northeast Pacific that logged high-resolution depth,
temperature, and relative light data for each individual for up to
nearly 3 years. We recovered 25 of these tags that recorded 10,360
deployment days spanning >235,000 km of cumulative horizontal
travel, primarily across the California Current, North Pacific Tran-
sition Zone, and North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (Fig. 1 and table
S1). Most individuals tagged in the northern California Current mi-
grated seasonally, moving westward along the North Pacific Transi-
tion Zone in fall and returning to the California Current in late
spring or early summer (fig. S1A). A subset of albacore tagged in

the southern California Current moved offshore into the North
Pacific Subtropical Gyre, but these fish migrated shorter distances
and with less predictable seasonality than those tagged in the north-
ern California Current. Other individuals tagged in the southern
California Current remained resident in this area for the entirety
of their time at large, up to 343 days. Albacore do extensive
diving throughout these North Pacific biomes, with daily cumula-
tive vertical travel throughout the water column averaging 7.9 km in
the northern California Current, 9.4 to 9.6 km in the southern Cal-
ifornia Current and North Pacific Transition Zone, and 12.2 km in
the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. The quantity of vertical move-
ment generally increased in concert with subsurface temperature
and light across these biomes, with albacore experiencing colder
and darker conditions in the California Current than in the
North Pacific Subtropical Gyre and Transition Zone over the
depth range of the lower epipelagic and upper mesopelagic
(fig. S1B).

Energetics
Idealized deep dives consistent with sustained foraging (U-shaped)
and prey searching (V-shaped) below the euphotic zone revealed
behavioral variation among oceanographic regimes. Foraging
dives (n = 2856) were characterized by a high proportion of
bottom time at a target depth and longer overall dive duration
that averaged ∼20 min (range, 10 min to >2 hours). Searching
dives (n = 10,338) were characterized by a low proportion of
bottom time and shorter average dive duration of 8 min (range, 5
to 23 min). We restricted our analyses to daytime deep dives because
such behavior almost never occurs at night when these fish are dis-
tributed nearly exclusively in the upper epipelagic. Across dive types
and biomes, a power function relating the metabolic cost rate to the
minimum ambient temperature experienced during a deep dive re-
vealed that for every 10% increase in the minimum ambient

temperature, there was a linear approximation of an 8% decrease in
the metabolic cost rate. The mean temperature conditions and cor-
responding metabolic and behavioral outcomes experienced by al-
bacore while conducting daytime dives below the euphotic zone
largely varied along a northeast to southwest gradient (Fig. 2).
The shallowest (mean, 29 m) and coldest (mean, 15.5°C) mixed
layer, the lowest minimum temperature at depth (mean, 7.4°C),
and the largest change in ambient temperature (mean, −8.6°C) ex-
perienced during such dives occurred in the northern California
Current, which corresponded to the highest metabolic cost rate in
this study (mean, 5.7 mg O2 kg−1 min−1 for U dives; fig. S2; see table
S2 for all U and V dive metrics). The high metabolic cost rate in this
region was consistent with the highest dive descent rate (mean, 1.0
m s−1) and the shortest foraging dive duration (mean, 16 min) and
bottom time (mean, 10 min). In contrast, albacore conducting

foraging dives in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre experienced
the deepest (mean, 55 m) and warmest (mean, 17.0°C) mixed
layer,
the warmest minimum temperature at depth (mean,
10.7°C), and the smallest change in ambient temperature (mean,
−6.2°C), driving the lowest metabolic cost rate (mean, 4.2 mg O2
kg−1 min−1) and dive descent rate (mean, 0.7 m s−1). This 26% de-
crease in the mean metabolic cost rate of a deep foraging dive in the
North Pacific Subtropical Gyre relative to the northern California
Current was associated with a longer foraging dive duration
(mean, 21 min) and bottom time (mean, 13 min) as albacore tran-
sitioned from colder to warmer biomes (fig. S2). Similarly, a proxy
for the potential profitability of a deep foraging dive, defined as the
bottom time (or available foraging time) per unit metabolic cost,
increased 37% from the northern California Current (mean, 0.103

−1 kg).

Light attenuation
Subsurface relative light levels recorded by the tags quantified the
midday (local solar noon ± 1 hour) light attenuation environment
and suggested diving albacore overlap with putative scattering layers
below the euphotic zone across their entire North Pacific range
(Fig. 1). Light attenuation was highest in epipelagic waters (calcu-
lated from 20 to 150 m for all regions) of the mesotrophic northern
California Current (mean, 0.041 m−1) and lowest in the oligotro-
phic North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (mean, 0.035 m−1); these con-
ditions were reflected in the decrease in light experienced by
albacore during deep foraging dives, which was largest in the north-
ern California Current (mean, −4.13 orders of magnitude) and
smallest in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (mean, −3.39
orders of magnitude). Colocating light attenuation profiles to clima-
tological deep chlorophyll maxima (DCM) depth by latitude
allowed us to isolate peaks in attenuation well below DCM depth
(>3 SDs below the mean; Fig. 3). Of the deployment days with
light attenuation profiles passing quality control and extending
below the DCM depth threshold (n = 3968), 17% exhibited increases
in attenuation at depths suggestive of scattering layers. This pres-
ence-only detection method was designed to conservatively identify
putative overlap with scattering layers only where chlorophyll could
not be confounding the attenuation signal. Using a within-biome
clustering approach of attenuation profiles with putative scattering
layer overlap, we identify important features governing the attenu-
ation of light within and across depth strata. For example, high
surface productivity in the California Current leads to at least
some profiles with high attenuation in the top 50 m (Fig. 3, C
and D). Similarly, DCM are apparent in at least one profile cluster
within each biome and drive peaks in attenuation centered at depths
up to 100 to 140 m in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, 60 to 100
m in the North Pacific Transition Zone, 50 to 90 m in the northern
California Current, and 60 to 100 m in the southern California
Current (Fig. 3). In contrast, peaks in attenuation presumably
driven by scattering layers occur below ∼200 m in the North
Pacific Subtropical Gyre and Transition Zone, 150 m in the north-
ern California Current, and 180 m in the Southern California
Current (Fig. 3). Furthermore, as the observed depths of putative
scattering layers deepened within and across biomes so did
depths of albacore foraging and searching dives (Fig. 3).

Scattering layers
Diel composites of shipboard acoustic measurements from 0 to 600
m highlighted biome-level variation in scattering layer depth and
structure (Fig. 4). The high attenuation environment of the Califor-
nia Current was characterized by two primary scattering layers in
the northern and southern regions: (i) a migrant DSL distributed
below ∼200 to 220 m at local noon but ascending to <100 m at
night and (ii) a nonmigrant DSL centered at ∼400 m across diel
periods (Fig. 4B). Accordingly, maximum foraging dive depth in
the northern (mean, 175 m) and southern (mean, 220 m) California
Current and concurrent increased light attenuation at depth (Fig. 3,
C and D) were consistent with overlap of the migrant DSL at ∼200
m but not the nonmigrant DSL that occurs markedly deeper (∼400
to 500 m; Fig. 4B). In contrast, three distinct mesopelagic scattering
layers were apparent in the North Central Pacific (i.e., across the

North Pacific Subtropical Gyre and Southern Transition Zone):
(i) a migrant shallow scattering layer (SSL) distributed from ∼200
to 300 m at local noon but ascending to <200 m at night, (ii) a
migrant DSL distributed below ∼400 m at local noon but ascending
to <200 m at night, and (iii) a nonmigrant DSL centered at ∼550 m
that was stationary across the diel cycle (Fig. 4B). Maximum depths
reached by albacore conducting daytime foraging dives below the
euphotic zone in the North Pacific Transition Zone (mean, 208
m) and North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (mean, 218 m) were consis-
tent with overlap of the migrant SSL but not the migrant nor non-
migrant DSLs below (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, concurrent increased
light attenuation at depth in these North Central Pacific biomes
highlighted overlap of the migrant SSL but not the deeper layers
(Fig. 3, A and B).

Given that daytime foraging dives by the predator almost never
overlapped with the deeper scattering layers (i.e., the nonmigrant
DSL in the California Current and both DSLs in the North
Central Pacific), we estimated the energetics of these hypothetical
dives and contrasted them against the energetics of the observed
dives that overlapped with the targeted scattering layer within
each biome. For example, in the northern California Current, a for-
aging dive to the nonmigrant DSL (∼400 m) might result in a met-
abolic rate 5% higher and overall cost 56% higher than a
behaviorally comparable dive to the migrant DSL (∼200 m). Alter-
natively, a dive to the nonmigrant DSL that is equivalent in overall
cost to a shallower dive that overlaps with the migrant DSL would
necessitate a 75% decrease in dive duration at foraging depths. In
the North Central Pacific, foraging dives to the migrant (∼400 m)
and nonmigrant (∼500 m) DSLs might result in a metabolic rate 20
or 31% higher and overall cost 80 or 121% higher, respectively, than
a behaviorally comparable dive to the migrant SSL (∼200 m). Alter-
natively, a dive to the migrant DSL that is equivalent in overall cost
to a shallower dive that overlaps with the migrant SSL would neces-
sitate an 80% decrease in dive duration at foraging depths. A dive to
the nonmigrant DSL cannot be made energetically equivalent to a
migrant SSL dive solely via reduction in duration at foraging depths.

DISCUSSION
Deep-diving albacore exhibited daytime overlap with scattering
layers throughout the North Pacific. Biome-level variation in tem-
perature, light attenuation, and scattering layer structure modulated
the bioenergetics of this behavior as a tradeoff between foraging dive
duration and metabolic rate. These results suggest that deep diving
helps physiologically capable pelagic predators to achieve bioener-
getic balance as part of a broader repertoire of foraging strategies.
The importance of this mesopelagic strategy relative to epipelagic
ones changes across biomes in concert with variation in their rela-
tive energetic profitability. Albacore diet in the California Current is
largely constituted by epipelagic forage fish, with a comparatively
smaller but substantive proportion composed of vertically migrat-
ing mesopelagic prey (29, 30, 31). In contrast, North Pacific albacore
diet is increasingly composed of mesopelagic prey farther offshore
(32, 33) and in more tropical water (34). This greater reliance on
mesopelagic prey is paralleled by warmer minimum temperatures
experienced during foraging dives to the scattering layer that
reduce the metabolic rate and extend the duration of such behavior.
However, this biome-level juxtaposition is seemingly enabled by the
addition of an SSL in the oligotrophic subtropical gyre and

transition zone that, if not present, would otherwise necessitate
dives into markedly deeper, colder water to reach the DSLs and
thereby inflate the metabolic rate and overall cost of scattering
layer forays in the open ocean. The shift in albacore diet between
more productive, neritic biomes to oligotrophic, offshore biomes
mirrors a concurrent change in overall vertical distribution where
albacore increase their daytime occupation of deeper strata (and
largely do not approach the near-surface) where warmer tempera-
tures at depth occur in other ocean basins (35, 36, 37). Similarly, the
ratio of mesopelagic to epipelagic prey in the diet of albacore is
higher in more oligotrophic/tropical than mesotrophic/temperate
waters in various parts of the world ocean (37, 38, 39), suggesting
that these bioenergetic results can be generalized as a model for un-
derstanding deep diving behavior with respect to such gradients
across the globe.

The composites of shipboard acoustics in the North Pacific Sub-
tropical Gyre and Southern Transition Zone were consistent with
previous acoustic characterizations of the North Central Pacific,

which highlighted the stable presence of backscattering below 500
m from migrant and nonmigrant DSLs and the comparatively
patchy occurrence of an SSL from 200 to 300 m during the
daytime (40, 41, 42). Similarly, the composites from the California
Current matched previous observations from other bioacoustics
platforms, with pronounced daytime scattering in this region con-
sisting of a migrant DSL typically between 180 and 300 m and non-
migrant DSL below 400 m (43, 44, 45). The shallower daytime
distributions of the migrant and nonmigrant DSLs in the California
Current compared to those offshore is consistent with mesopelagic
organisms occupying a preferred range of light intensity and, thus, a
position deeper in the water column when in a biome characterized
by low light attenuation (15, 25) such as the oligotrophic North
Pacific. This responsiveness of mesopelagic organisms to subsurface
light levels is evident even across (sub)mesoscale fronts within the
California Current, where scattering layers are more vertically strat-
ified on the offshore than inshore side of these features because of
the presence of clearer waters farther offshore (44). The structuring

jointly constitute the composite of the North Central Pacific (A), a mesopelagic ecoregion distinct from that of the California Current (46). Data from the California Current
are of the southern region (B), the composite of which is parallel to that of the northern region and representative of the biome as a whole. Daytime (hours 6 to 18) and

effect of light on the migrant and nonmigrant DSLs is present al-
though the community composition of these mesopelagic fauna is
largely distinct between the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre/Transi-
tion Zone and California Current (46), with the most notable dif-
ference being the more consistent presence of the SSL offshore. The
variable but more consistent presence of an SSL appears to charac-
terize subtropical gyres, as studies from the North Pacific (41),
South Indian (40), and North Atlantic (20) all found a temporally
patchy SSL in the corresponding subtropical gyre but the general
disappearance of this feature in surrounding water masses. In
areas typically devoid of an observable SSL, the seasonal appearance
of this upper layer may represent the seasonal displacement and
shifting boundaries of distinct water masses (18, 19).

For diving pelagic predators, the characteristics of prey patches
(including their vertical distribution) are far more important to for-
aging efficiency than overall prey biomass (47). The SSL in the
North Central Pacific may be patchily distributed (40, 41, 42), but
if this prey structure did not exist, then it would require albacore to
dive to at least the top of the migrant DSL at depths >400 m (more
than doubling the vertical distance travelled below the mixed layer)
where temperatures approach the colder conditions experienced
while deep diving in the northern California Current. The markedly
reduced metabolic cost of targeting the SSL rather than (hypothet-
ically) either the migrant or nonmigrant DSL in the North Central
Pacific highlights the centrality of this patchy prey structure to bal-
ancing the energetic budget of deep-diving predators that are phys-
iologically restricted to the upper mesopelagic. Furthermore, the
orders-of-magnitude-higher light levels present at the daytime
depths of an SSL than DSL (15) should (for a given volumetric
density of prey) increase the rate of predator-prey encounters and,
thus, food intake [sensu (48, 49)].

Daytime targeting of the SSL at depth is not only a potentially
viable strategy in comparison to targeting deeper scattering layers
but may also be relevant when compared to the nighttime alterna-
tive of foraging on prey that migrate toward the surface. The dura-
tion of potential nighttime overlap of predators with mesopelagic
prey in this oligotrophic biome is reduced by the earlier departure
from, and later arrival to, the epipelagic by organisms undergoing
diel vertical migration in subtropical gyres (up to 90 min before
sunrise/after sunset) relative to the same migrations in waters
with lower optical clarity (such as the California Current) where mi-
gration times are more closely coupled to sunrise/sunset (Fig. 4)
(50). The temporal constriction of this nighttime foraging opportu-
nity is exacerbated by a markedly lower migrating proportion of or-
ganisms in the central than eastern Pacific (16, 41) that together may
substantially increase the relative energetic profitability of daytime
mesopelagic foraging by predators in the oligotrophic North Pacific.
Among deep-diving species within the North Pacific Subtropical
Gyre and/or Transition Zone, those that are more thermally
limited appear to largely target depths consistent with the distribu-
tion of the SSL [e.g., albacore (this study) and blue shark (51)], while
those with greater physiological scope increasingly target depths
consistent with the distributions of the DSLs [e.g., swordfish (52)
and northern elephant seal (53)].

The repeated migrations of albacore between the California
Current and North Central Pacific highlight the regional predict-
ability of prey in these two major foraging grounds. Albacore re-
turning from the North Central Pacific in summer encounter the
highest abundances of sardine, anchovy, and euphausiids in the
northern California Current but the distributions of these prey
exhibit substantial spatiotemporal variability (54–56). This is re-
flected in the flexible diet composition of albacore in the California

Current from year to year (31). The abundance and horizontal dis-
tribution patterns of albacore prey in the North Central Pacific are
not as well documented. Notably, the heat increment of feeding (a
proxy for energy intake) measured in albacore occupying the North
Pacific Subtropical Gyre and Southern Transition Zone is far higher
than would be expected from the low availability of epipelagic prey
(57). While the taxonomic composition of the SSL on which alba-
core appear to feed during the daytime in the North Central Pacific
remains unknown, the mismatch between observed energy intake
and epipelagic prey biomass is consistent with a primarily mesope-
lagic diet. The greater potential profitability of deep daytime forag-
ing dives in the North Central Pacific (this study) may be facilitated
by albacore primarily occupying this region during the wintertime
deepening of the mixed layer (58). With North Pacific mixed layer
depth at its winter maximum (59) and shoaling of isolumes during
winter (60) resulting in a relatively shallower distribution of scatter-
ing layers (61), albacore may energetically benefit from reduced ver-
tical distance between their thermal refuge and mesopelagic prey on
seasonal time scales. The potential energetic value of these offshore
biomes to deep-diving pelagic predators of the North Pacific is
further corroborated by a global-scale model of blue shark habitat
that predicted favorable upper mesopelagic foraging conditions in
oligotrophic waters (62), satellite telemetry of diverse predators re-
vealing high-use areas in the gyre and transition zone (63), and a
fishery-dependent analysis that found aggregation of the predator
community within oceanographic features hosting enhanced meso-
pelagic foraging opportunities in the gyre (23). The foraging of
deep-diving predators in the subtropical gyre and transition zone
biomes, even if only seasonally [e.g., white shark (64)] or during a
particular life stage [e.g., salmon shark (65)], indicates that reliance
on the prey resources of the open ocean is a major component of the
ecology of many pelagic predators.

Given burgeoning interest in scattering layer fisheries (66), pre-
dictions for climate change to cause a global decline of scattering
layer fauna (67), and scattering layer research being predominantly
focused on the globally distributed primary DSL (16, 17), increased
effort is needed to understand the ecology and biogeography of the
SSL in the mid-latitudes. The occurrence of an SSL in multiple sub-
tropical gyres (20, 40), the oligotrophic Red Sea (68), and elsewhere
under specific oligotrophic conditions (19), merits investigation to
determine whether high light penetration driving the DSL(s) deeper
increases ecological niche availability via vertical segregation. Poor
spatial and temporal sampling coverage across the world ocean pre-
cludes clear delineation of the core and seasonal distribution of the
SSL, and it remains unknown why this prey structure has been ob-
served as migrant in one subtropical gyre (this study) and nonmi-
grant in another (20). Such distribution and migration dynamics are
critical to understanding the mechanistic links between oceano-
graphic regime, scattering layer structure, and prey availability to
predators that ultimately influence the ecosystem risks of extracting
mesopelagic biomass (69). The presence of the SSL appears vital to
achieving bioenergetic balance in oligotrophic waters for pelagic
predators that are physiologically restricted to the upper mesopelag-
ic. This understudied link appears to enable higher trophic level life
in the open ocean, including supporting important global fisheries,
and highlights the unquantified ecosystem services provided by the
ocean twilight zone.

METHODS
Archival tagging and geolocation
All tagging was done in accordance with protocols approved by the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
Southwest Fisheries Science Center, Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee. The tagging dataset was generated by a collab-
orative effort between the NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science
Center and the American Fishermen’s Research Foundation (35).
Each albacore (n = 25) was fitted with one of three types of archival
tag (Lotek LTD2310, Lotek LAT2810, and Wildlife Computers
MK9) that recorded depth, ambient (water) temperature, internal
(visceral) temperature, and relative light level at 30- or 60-s resolu-
tion. These fish were between 63.5- and 89.9-cm straight fork length
at release, at large for 62 to 1034 (median, 345) days, and cumula-
tively travelled 279 to 37,005 (median, 5572) km horizontally. The
most probable tracks of the albacore fitted with archival tags were
constructed using a hidden Markov model comparing tag-based
observations against oceanographic measurements and ocean-re-
solving model outputs to generate position estimates (see Supple-
mentary Methods for more details on the tagging and geolocation).

Dive extraction and classification
Daytime dives (after sunrise and before sunset) potentially in
pursuit of scattering layer prey were extracted to examine behavioral
variation and underlying environmental drivers across the biomes
of the North Pacific. Albacore vertical movement behavior is closely
coupled to the mixed layer (35, 36); thus, we defined the start and
end of individual dives as occurring 10 m below the mixed layer
depth, facilitating quantitative comparison of dives across variable
oceanographic conditions (see Supplementary Methods for detail
on estimation of the mixed layer depth). Scattering layers occur at
depths below the euphotic zone; therefore, we only included dives in
which the maximum depth was greater than the lower depth limit of
the DCM in each 10o latitudinal band [≥mean DCM depth + 3 SDs
(70)]. Dives were assigned three phases, with the bottom phase oc-
curring at depths ≥75% of the max depth of the focal dive and
descent and ascent phases occurring before and after the bottom
phase, respectively, at depths <75% of the max depth of the focal
dive. The dive duration was defined as the sum of the descent,
bottom, and ascent phases. After filtering and multivariate classifi-
cation of dives into distinct types, we retained U-shaped (sustained
foraging) or V-shaped (prey searching) dives on 3064 (30%) of the
10,360 deployment days (see Supplementary Methods for details on
dive filtering and classification).

Bioenergetics
To quantify the bioenergetic costs of albacore diving to putatively
forage on or search for scattering layer prey, we used a previously
published generalized additive model predicting total metabolic
rate (active + standard, mg O2 kg−1 hour−1) as a function of swim-
ming speed (body lengths s−1) and water temperature (71). This
model, based on experimental results from the closely related and
physiologically similar Pacific bluefin tuna (Thunnus orientalis),
yielded predictions for albacore at every time step of the archival
depth-temperature series data from the tags (see Supplementary
Methods for more details on the application of the bioener-
getic model).

Light attenuation profiling
Light attenuation profiles were constructed from the archival depth-
light series data to characterize the subsurface optical environment
experienced by albacore across North Pacific biomes. We expanded
upon the trawllight package for R (72) to derive attenuation from
tag-measured irradiance taken during albacore vertical movements
(see Supplementary Methods for more details on the profiling
methodology and compositing of clustered profiles). The overlap
of albacore with scattering layers was assessed by analyzing filtered
light attenuation profiles extending below the euphotic zone where
chlorophyll is negligible and increased attenuation may represent
the presence of high concentrations of scattering layer organisms
(73). We developed a custom algorithm to detect marked increases
in attenuation occurring deeper than the lower limit (99.7th percen-
tile) of DCM depth distribution, thereby conservatively identifying
the presence of scattering layers only where chlorophyll concentra-
tions should not be confounding. The DCM depth distribution
values, calculated per 10° latitudinal band, come from a global anal-
ysis of >500 biogeochemical Argo profiling floats yielding >68,000
vertical chlorophyll profiles (70). Our approach represents the first
attempt to map predator overlap with putative scattering layers
across their tracked distribution as derived from analysis of
animal-borne measurement of depth-light series data.

Among- and across-biome dive analyses
To compare dive metrics among biomes, we built linear mixed-
effects models of the variables of interest as a function of modified
Longhurst province. These models included a variance structure to
account for heterogeneous variance among modified Longhurst
provinces and a random effect for individual to account for the
nested nature of the dataset. Across modified Longhurst provinces
and dive types, the metabolic cost rate of diving was modeled as a
power function of minimum temperature (see Supplementary
Methods for details on province modification and related models).

Bioacoustics composites
To assess biome-level variation in scattering layer depth and com-
position, we constructed depth-averaged, 24-hour composites of
volumetric backscattering with acoustic Doppler current profile
(ADCP) data from the Joint Archive for Shipboard ADCP (74)
for three regions across our North Pacific study area: the North
Central Pacific (26° to 40°N, 200° to 220°E), northern California
Current (41° to 49°N, 228° to 235°E), and southern California
Current (25° to 33°N, 239° to 246°E). The instruments included
in the composites were Teledyne Research Instruments ADCPs
(TRDI) with operating frequencies of 38 (8%), 75 (31%), and 150
(61%) kHz. This range of frequencies enabled detection of diverse
organisms potentially contributing to pelagic predator diet; 38 and
75 kHz best detect (micro)nekton scatterers such as fishes and ceph-
alopods, whereas 150 kHz best detects macrozooplankton scatterers
such as euphausiids (14). The profiles included in the composites
were determined as any 24-hour diurnal cycle for which the
mean position of the cruise fell within one of the regions of interest:
North Central Pacific (219 cruise days), northern California
Current (305 cruise days), and southern California Current (226
cruise days) (see Supplementary Methods for more details on the
acoustic methodology).
