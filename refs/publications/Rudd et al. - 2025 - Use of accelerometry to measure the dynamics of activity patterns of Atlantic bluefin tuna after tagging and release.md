Abstract
Research on the direct effects of capture and tagging on post-release behaviour is typically limited to short-
term deployments. To investigate the initial and longer-term behavioural responses to capture and tagging, we
deployed eight Cefas G7 tags (1Hz depth and temperature, and 20 Hz triaxial acceleration) for 21–94 hours and
12 Wildlife Computers MiniPATs (depth, temperature, light and triaxial acceleration, each at 0.2 Hz) for 110–366
days on Atlantic bluefin tuna (ABT) in the English Channel. Post-release, ABT exhibited a strong, highly active initial
swimming response, consistent with patterns reported in previous bluefin tuna, billfish and elasmobranch tracking
studies. Accelerometry tags revealed that activity (VeDBA g), tailbeat amplitude (g) and dominant stroke frequency
(Hz) were greater (2.4, 3.2 and 1.4 times respectively) within the first hour post-release than the subsequent 24
hours, stabilising at lower levels within 5–9 hours. However, lower resolution accelerometry data (0.2 Hz), obtained
from longer periods from MiniPATs, revealed that fish then maintained this reduced activity for 11 ± 7.9 days
(mean ± 1 SD; range: 2–26 days), during which they displayed disrupted diel patterns of activity and allocated
on average 5 minutes of each day to burst energy events, compared to 14 minutes (max 74 minutes) during
“recovered” periods. Subsequently, their activity levels increased again and were characterised by higher magnitude
acceleration events (which may constitute feeding events) and became more active during the day than at night.
Year-long deployments revealed that consistent diel vertical migration, diurnal patterns of activity, and increased
time allocation to fast starts are normal for ABT off the British Isles in summer months, and their absence at the
start of data collection may be related to the effect of capture and tagging, which may be longer lasting, and more
complex than previously appreciated.

Background
Biologging  of  bony  fish  and  elasmobranchs  has  contrib-
uted  to  stock  and  mortality  assessments  [1–3],  welfare
management  in  recreational  fisheries  and  aquaculture
[4,  5],  protected  area  designation  [6],  invasive  species
control [7] and fisheries management [8, 9]. Tracking of
wild fish often requires capture, tagging and handling of
animals  prior  to  release,  which  may  induce  behavioural
changes  [10,  11],  physiological  stress  [12–17],  or  even
mortality  [18,  19].  Hence,  addressing  and  mitigating  the
adverse effects of capture, tagging and release is needed.

Fish  in  captive  studies  can  be  acclimated  for  a  period
of time following handling and/or tagging prior to study
[20, 21], but this is largely unfeasible in the field, particu-
larly for large marine species. To avoid including periods
of  acclimation  to  attached  or  implanted  devices,  studies
often  exclude  data  at  the  start  of  tracking  periods  for  a
(usually  arbitrary)  period,  ranging  from  hours  to  weeks
[22–29]. However, there is a lack of baseline understand-
ing  of  when  sub-lethal  effects  subside  and  when  the
study animal returns  to “normal”  [30]. This  understand-
ing might be gained using high-resolution tri-axial accel-
eration  data  [31]  but  has  rarely  been  achieved  owing  to
battery  power  and  memory  capacity  limitations  [32].
Consequently,  studies  investigating  post-release  behav-
iour using accelerometry typically last from minutes [11,
33, 34] to a few days [10, 15].

Atlantic  bluefin  tuna  (Thunnus  thynnus,  hereafter
ABT)  are  highly  migratory  pelagic  predators  distrib-
uted throughout the North Atlantic Ocean [8, 9, 35–37],
whose  population  biomass  is  increasing  [38].  Whilst
electronic  tagging  studies  have  provided  valuable  data
to support management of ABT stocks [3, 39, 40], there
remains only a superficial understanding of the response
of  ABT  to  capture,  tagging  and  release  over  timescales
longer  than  a  few  days  [41–44].  Better  understanding
of  how  the  capture  and  tagging  process  impacts  ABT
behaviour is therefore essential to maximise the value of
tagging data.

Previous  studies  on  ABT  support  that  post-release,
capture  and  tagging  has  an  immediate  effect  on  swim-
ming behaviour, with tailbeat frequencies that were 50%
higher  in  the  first  hour  post-tagging  and  release  com-
pared  to  the  subsequent  24  h  [44]  and  remained  high
for  up  to  6  h  [45].  Iosilevskii  et  al.  [16]  and  Gleiss  et  al.
[45]  reported  swimming  speeds  that  were  twice  and  1.7
times  higher,  respectively,  in  the  first  six  hours  than  in
the  hours  afterwards.  However,  although  ABT  recover
well from capture and tagging [3, 8, 41, 46], as evidenced
by observations of important behaviours (e.g. spawning)
from tagged ABT [39, 47, 48], it is unclear if the response
to  catch-and-release  persists  over  a  longer  period  (e.g.
days  to  weeks)  rather  than  the  short  periods  suggested
to  date.  This  may  be  particularly  important  if  ABT  are

caught and tagged when they are about to perform eco-
logically  significant  behaviours  such  as  spawning,  which
may  be  disrupted  as  a  result  of  the  capture  and  tagging
process.  Minimising  the  post-release  response  is  para-
mount for their welfare [49].

In the present study, we make use of long-term deploy-
ments  and  retrievals  of  archival  pop-up  tags  to  make
observations  on  the  potential  long-term  effects  of  cap-
ture and tagging on ABT tracked off the British Isles.

Methods
Tag deployments

Between  October  2018  and  November  2021,  81  ABT
(mean  curved  fork  length:  198 ± 22  cm,  range:  153–
242  cm)  were  captured  off  the  southwest  coast  of
England,  Wales  and  the  Channel  Island  of  Jersey,  by
professional  rod  and  reel  anglers,  using  trolled  lures
attached to spreader bars and 50 or 80 lb class reels. Fish-
ing metrics were recorded including gear type (line test,
hook  type),  fight  time  (duration  from  initial  hooking  to
the fish being brought alongside the boat), handling time
(time  from  which  fish  were  boarded  until  release  back
to the water), and water depth at release. Captured tuna
were  assessed  for  their  fitness  for  tagging  and  again  for
their fitness for release back to the wild (Supplementary
Fig.  1).  On-deck,  their  gills  were  irrigated  with  saltwa-
ter  while  the  tagging  procedure  took  place  (for  detailed
handling methods, see [37]) and they were then returned
to the water and towed using a ‘boga grip’ (Pratiko, Italy)
or  lip  hook  at  the  side  or  rear  of  the  vessel < 5  knots  to
aid reoxygenation. Fight times ranged from 10 to 34 min,
handling  times  ranged  from  1.3  to  3.5  min  (mean
2.6 ± 0.5  min),  and  all  ABT  were  towed  for  4.3 ± 1.4  min
(range  1.3–7.3  min)  before  release  (Table  1).  Eleven
ABT  were  tagged  with  packages  that  comprised  a  Cefas
G7  pDST  accelerometer  tag  (Cefas  Technology  Limited
CTL, UK), coupled with a mrPAT or mrSPOT tag (model
375,  Wildlife  Computers,  WA,  USA)  to  facilitate  recov-
ery  of  the  tag  following  its  release  from  the  ABT. These
packages  were  attached  front  and  aft  using  cable  ties  to
a  saddle  of  two  galvanic  time  releases,  which  corroded
over  a  period  of  2–4  days,  eventually  releasing  the  tag
package.  G7  tags  were  programmed  to  collect  tempera-
ture  and  depth  at  1  Hz  frequency,  and  tri-axial  accel-
eration  at  20  Hz  (n = 9  fish)  or  30  Hz  (n = 2  fish).  Data
gathered  at  30  Hz  were  decimated  to  20  Hz  through
linear  interpolation  using  the  R  package  “dplyr”  so  that
all  G7  tags  could  be  analysed  at  the  same  frequency.  A
further  70  fish  (mean  curved  fork  length:  197 ± 23  cm,
range: 153–242 cm) were tagged with Wildlife Comput-
ers MiniPAT tags, attached by a monofilament tether to
a titanium dart inserted intramuscularly near the second
dorsal  fin.  The  tag  was  held  in  place  with  an  additional
loop that was also attached by an intramuscular titanium

dart  [37,  50].  MiniPAT  tags  recorded  depth,  tempera-
ture,  tri-axial  acceleration  and  light  level  at  0.2  Hz  (1
data  point  every  5  s)  or  0.067  Hz  (one  data  point  every
15  s)  for  a  year.  A  total  of  27  MiniPAT  tags  and  8  G7
tags  were  retrieved  after  detachment  from  the  ABT.  By
down-sampling  data  from  the  high-resolution  tags  to
various frequencies (ranging from 20 Hz to 0.05 Hz), tail-
beat  signal  from  the  lateral  acceleration  was  lost  below
5  Hz  and  bursts  in  acceleration  could  only  be  detected
above  0.2  Hz.  Thus,  the  fifteen  MiniPAT  tags  recording
at 0.067 Hz were excluded from the present study as the
resolution  was  deemed  too  low  to  retrieve  post-release
behaviour. A total of 20 recovered tags (n = 8 G7 tags and
n = 12  MiniPAT  tags)  were  then  included  in  the  present
study  (Table  1).  The  Wildlife  Computers  Global  Posi-
tion  Estimator  3  (GPE3)  light  geolocation  model  ( h t t p  s :

likelihood  rasters  for  the  MiniPAT  datasets,  where  cells
with < 1% likelihood were omitted from further analysis.
Mean bathymetry was extracted from General Bathymet-
ric  Chart  of  the  Ocean  (GEBCO,  gebco.net;  resolution
0.004°) using the R package “raster”. Mean bathymetry for
each location was expressed as the grand mean depth of
each raster cell, weighted by the likelihood values.

Data processing

To  account  for  differing  tag  attachment  orientation  on
each  tuna,  accelerometry  data  were  calibrated  follow-
ing rotations of known angles using the R package “tag-
tools”,  once  data  were  processed  to  20  Hz  for  G7  tags.
This  enables  each  tag’s  frame  of  reference  to  be  aligned
with  the  tuna’s  axes  and  be  comparable  between  indi-
viduals. The accelerometry data from the MiniPAT (col-
lected a 0.2 Hz) were processed in the same way. Depth
was  temperature  corrected  using  the  R  package  “tag-
tools”.  “Activity”  was  defined  using  accelerometery  data,
which  comprises  two  components,  (i)  low-frequency
static acceleration and (ii) high-frequency dynamic accel-
eration.  The  static  component  relates  to  the  inclination
of  the  tag  with  respect  to  the  earth’s  gravitational  field
(which is analogous to the ABT’s body posture) and was
obtained  by  individually  smoothing  each  of  the  three
acceleration  channels  with  a  running  mean  of  two  sec-
onds for the G7 tags (following [51]). Dynamic accelera-
tion  relating  to  the  tuna’s  movement  [52]  was  obtained
by subtracting the static acceleration from the raw accel-
eration in all three axes and then expressed as Vectorial
Dynamic  Body  Acceleration  (VeDBA;  [53]).  A  spectro-
gram of the lateral acceleration was generated in Ethog-
rapher ver. 2.04 [54] in Igor Pro (Igor Pro 8, WaveMetrics
Inc., Lake Oswego, USA), calculated by continuous wave-
let transformation using the Marlet wavelet function with
a  minimum  cycle  of  0.125  s  and  maximum  cycle  of  2  s

for each fish [54]. Tailbeat amplitude (TBA; g) was calcu-
lated for each 1 s interval using the Peak Tracer function
in Igor Pro. Dominant stroke frequency (DSF) was calcu-
lated using the R package “tagtools”, with tailbeat period
(TBP) calculated as the inverse of DSF, in seconds. TBA,
TBP and DSF for each ABT were divided by the curved
fork length to correct for size. Since ABT tailbeat signal is
lost below 5 Hz sampling frequency, TBA, TBP and DSF
metrics  were  only  extracted  for  the  G7  tags.  To  investi-
gate whether the activity of G7-tagged ABT differed from
those  tagged  with  MiniPATs,  G7  data  were  down-sam-
pled to 0.2 Hz to match the MiniPAT tags and expressed
using  VeDBA  calculated  over  a  10  s  smoothing  window
(Supplementary Fig. 2). Due to differences in attachment
styles between tag types, fine scale movement of the tag
(“wobble”) differed slightly between tag types (see discus-
sion below).

Immediate response post-release

For  G7  tags,  a  mean  value  was  calculated  for  VeDBA,
TBA,  DSF  and  TBP  for  each  hour,  per  fish,  for  the  first
24  h  of  deployment,  and  metrics  were  deemed  to  have
stabilised  once  mean  values  had  plateaued  (right-sided
asymptote).  The  overall  plateau  time,  representing  the
mean timing at which swimming metrics plateaued, was
calculated  across  all  fish.  Mean  hourly  VeDBA  was  also
calculated  for  MiniPAT  tags  and  for  the  down-sampled
G7  accelerometry  data  for  each  hour  of  deployment.
Trends  in  mean  hourly  activity  for  the  first  24  h  post-
release  (considered
‘immediately  post-release’)  were
visualised  using  the  “geom_smooth”  function  in  R  using
the  formula  y ~ s(x)  from  the  family  “loess”.  Other  large
billfish  and  tuna  species  have  previously  been  observed
making  an  initial,  sudden  near  vertical  dive  following
release,  which  is  thought  to  be  linked  to  a  physiological
stress response, and/or perhaps thermoregulatory behav-
iour. They often remained at depth for an atypically long
period  before  returning  to  shallower  waters  [55–57].  In
the  current  study,  the  duration  of  the  first  dive  (defined
as  > 10  m  and  lasting  at  least  20  s,  before  returning  to
< 10  m,  following  [57])  was  plotted  against  fight  time.
Depth  data  from  G7  tags  were  down-sampled  to  match
the sampling frequency of the MiniPAT tags. Depth data
for both tag types were then smoothed to a 10 s running
mean.

Longer term patterns of behavior

To determine whether activity and depth patterns of each
ABT for the first seven days following capture and tagging
differed  from  the  overall  behavioural  patterns  observed
in  the  first  month  post-release,  a  resampling  test  using
similarity values was performed following [19] on the 12
MiniPAT tags. Pair-wise correlation coefficients of mean
hourly VeDBA and depth values for MiniPAT data were

calculated daily, for the first and last 30 days post-release
separately  (i.e.  day  1  against  day  2,  day  1  against  day  3,
...  day  30  against  day  1  etc.)  using  the  function  “ccf ”  in
R  with  zero  lags,  with  activity  and  depth  analysed  sepa-
rately. Cross-correlation values ranged between − 1 and 1
(perfect  negative  and  positive  correlation,  respectively),
while  values  of  0  indicated  no  association.  Median  cor-
relation  values  (from  here  on  ‘daily  similarity  values’)
were  then  calculated  for  each  day.  Days  with  dissimilar
patterns  of  behaviour  would  be  expected  to  have  values
lower than 0. Days were then ranked from 1 to 30 based
on daily similarity values, from lowest (day most dissimi-
lar to the overall pattern) to highest (day most similar to
the  overall  pattern).  The  rank  of  daily  similarity  values
for  each  fish  was  shuffled  10,000  times  without  replace-
ment using the R package “resample” and the first seven
values  from  each  reiteration  sampled  to  represent  days
1–7  post-release.  Values  falling  below  the  5th  percentile
of the distribution of resampled values for each day were
considered  significantly  different  to  the  overall  behav-
ioural  pattern.  Following  [19],  post-release  behaviour  in
the first week following release was considered different
if at least one of the first seven days’ similarity values was
lower than the 5th percentile of resampled values, as well
as the average rank of the first 7 days being below 15 (i.e.
the lower half of correlation values) (see Tables 2 and 3).

Since  fish  exhibited  inconsistent  behavioural  patterns,
as  indicated  by  low  daily  similarity  values  and  a  lack  of
clear diel behaviour (see “Overall diel patterns of activity
and depth” methods below) for periods extending beyond
the  first  week,  a  criterion  was  established  to  determine
when  they  resumed  a  consistent  pattern  of  diel  behav-
iour.  Return  of  diel  behaviour  was  defined  as  occurring
when fish displayed at least three days of diurnal behav-
iour within a seven-day window (e.g. vertical red line in
Fig. 2). Owing to small sample sizes and multiple possible
interacting variables, ABT length, weight, fight time, total
handling  time,  ambient  temperature  and  lunar  phase
were  tested  independently  for  influence  on  the  timing
of  the  return  of  cyclical  pattern  of  activity,  using  linear
regressions.

Finally,  the  11th  month  of  tracking  data  (last  30  days
of deployment for fish with over 330 days tracking days,
n = 6 fish) was used as a control to compare activity and
depth patterns with the first 30 days post-release. By this
point,  ABT  had  returned  to  locations  similar  to  where
they were initially captured and were experiencing condi-
tions  and  bathymetry  comparable  to  those  prior  to  tag-
ging.  While  the  sublethal  effects  of  capture  and  tagging
were  expected  to  have  subsided  within  a  month,  ABT
activity and depth use are known to vary with migration
phases [58], so behavioural patterns observed outside of
their  English  Channel  feeding  grounds  may  not  reflect
how  the  ABT  would  typically  be  behaving  had  capture

* Fish that also had altered patterns of activity

and  tagging  not  occurred.  We  therefore  excluded  any
comparisons  of  months  2–10  post-release  due  to  the
ABT likely being in different places or at different times
to when there were initially tagged.

Impact of capture, tagging and release on the
spatiotemporal variation in “fast start” events

‘Fast starts’ are sudden, brief, acceleration bursts, poten-
tially  associated  with  predator-prey  encounters  and/or
other  feeding  activities  [59];  though  without  simultane-
ous  video  validation  [60]  or  archival  tags  measuring  the
heat  increment  of  feeding  [61],  foraging  behaviour  can-
not  be  confirmed.  Fast  starts  were  determined  in  the
present study following methods in [62] as events where
VeDBA  values  were  above  the  99th  percentile  of  the
entire deployment period for MiniPAT tags (Supplemen-
tary  Fig.  3).  The  time  allocated  to  fast  start  events  per
week  during  the  first  and  last  30  days  post-release  was
then compared.

Overall diel patterns of activity and depth

Sunrise  and  sunset  times  derived  from  light  levels  (via
GPE3  outputs)  were  used  to  partition  periods  of  day
and  night.  For  each  MiniPAT  tagged  ABT  (n = 12),  a
mean  VeDBA  and  mean  depth  value  was  calculated  for

each day and night periods, and diel patterns of activity
tested using Welch t-tests, or Wilcoxon rank sum tests if
data  were  not  normally  distributed.  Activity  was  classi-
fied  as  either  diurnal,  nocturnal,  or  neither,  and  average
daily  depth  values  were  compared  for  day  and  night-
time  periods  using  Welch  t-tests  or  Wilcoxon  rank  sum
tests. Differences in VeDBA and mean depth were com-
pared for the first and last 30 days of deployment for the
six  ABT  that  had  year-long  MiniPAT  deployments.  To
test whether the lunar cycle influenced the overall depth
use  and  activity  in  the  first  and  last  30  days  of  deploy-
ment,  moon  phase  was  extracted  using  dates  with  the
R  package  “lunar”.  Then,  mean  depth  and  activity  were
compared  between  moon  phases  using  Kruskal  Wallis
rank-sum  tests.  The  effect  of  bathymetry  on  depth  use,
and  the  timing  of  when  diel  depth  behaviour  returned,
was also examined.

Movement

Minimum  straight-line  distance  between  daily  locations
from  MiniPAT  data  were  calculated  using  the  “oce”  R
package,  and  a  straightness  index  (SI)  was  calculated  as
the  minimum  horizontal  distance  between  release  and
pop-off  locations,  divided  by  the  cumulative  distance
travelled  by  the  ABT  between  these  points  [63].  SIs

Rudd et al. Movement Ecology           (2025) 13:37 Page 6 of 19

were  calculated  for  the  first  and  last  30  days  of  deploy-
ment,  as  well  as  weekly  for  the  first  and  last  four  weeks
of  the  deployment,  and  compared  using  Welch  t-tests.
ABT  daily  locations  were  classified  into  two  latent  cat-
egorical  states:  (1)  directed  movement  and  (2)  localised
movement, using Hidden Markov Models (HMM) in the
R package “MoveHMM” R [64]. Step lengths were mod-
elled  using  a  Gamma  distribution,  and  turning  angles
were modelled using a Von Mises distribution. Directed
swimming was associated with larger travel distances and
directional  persistence,  where  turning  angles  were  close
to 0, while localised movement was assumed to be asso-
ciated  with  short  travelling  distances  and  high  turning
angles. Models were checked using the pseudo-residuals
[64].  To  test  whether  patterns  of  depth  use  were  influ-
enced  by  movement  states,  mean  daytime  and  night-
time  depths  were  compared  for  periods  of  directed  and
localised  swimming  for  both  the  first  30  days  and  the
last 30 days of deployment separately. Generalised linear
mixed models (GLMM) were fitted to the data with mean
depth  as  the  response  variable.  Daytime  or  nighttime,
and behavioural state (directed and localised movement)
were  included  as  fixed  effects,  while  variation  between
fish was accounted for by specifying tag ID as a random
effect.  GLMMs  were  fitted  with  log-transformed  data
using the “lme4” package in R. Models were checked by
visually inspecting standardised residuals using the “Per-
formance” package.

Results
Behaviour immediately following release

Fight time increased significantly for heavier ABT (linear
regression,  y = 0.11x + 3.52;  R2 = 0.25,  p = 0.04,  Fig.  1A).
Following  release,  most  ABT  made  an  initial  dive  to
34 ± 15.9  m  (mean ± SD,  range  16–75  m,  mean  seafloor
depth at site of release 69 ± 13.5 m, range: 43–107 m) for
between  8  and  175  min  (mean  51.7 ± 46.5  min).  While
estimated  weight  had  no  influence  on  dive  duration
(linear  regression:  y = 0.09x + 45.04;  R2 = 0.005,  p = 0.78,
Fig.  1D),  fight  time  significantly  increased  dive  dura-
tion  (linear  regression:  y = 4.05–8.35;  R2 = 0.42,  p < 0.01;
Fig.  1B),  with  each  minute  of  fighting  resulting  in
4.05 ± 1.27 min longer dives. Handling time at the vessel
did not have a significant effect on dive  duration (linear
regression:  y=-9.73x + 72.28;  R2=-0.03,  p = 0.55,  Fig.  1E)
nor  the  maximum  depth  of  the  dive  (linear  regres-
sion:  y=-1.10x + 33.48;  R2 = 0.003,  p = 0.86,  Fig.  1F).  The
maximum depth reached by ABT in the initial dive also
increased significantly with fight time (linear regression,
R2 = 0.27, p = 0.04, depth = 1.11 fight time + 16.32; Fig. 1C).

on  average  of  8.3 ± 3.9  days,  with  a  straightness  index

day− 1  during  periods  of  directed  movement  compared
to 22.8 ± 22.8 km.day− 1 during periods of localised move-
ment.  Eight  fish  made  directed  movements  for  up  to  14
days (straightness index: 0.66 ± 0.28), where they travelled
on  average  552  km  (± 26  km  range:  187–813  km)  away
from their tagging location regardless of tagging year or
month (late August to mid-November) (Figs. 2, 3 and 4).
Their movements then became significantly more tortu-
ous, with a lower mean straightness index (SIweek3= 0.48,
Welch t-test, t = 4.95, p < 0.001, and SIweek4=0.40, t = 5.49,
p < 0.001 respectively; Figs. 2 and 4).

Behaviour in the 24 h following release

ABT  tagged  with  G7  tags  were  2.4 ± 0.53  times  more
active in the first hour post-release (VeDBA: 0.18 ± 0.06 g,
range:  0.11–0.30  g)  than  the  subsequent  24  h  (VeDBA:
0.07 ± 0.01  g;  Fig.  5A).  Tailbeat  amplitude  was  also
3.2 ± 0.83  times  greater  (0.17 ± 0.04  g,  vs.  0.06 ± 0.02  g)
and  dominant  stroke  frequency  1.4 ± 0.15  times  greater
(1.61 ± 0.16  Hz,  vs.  1.18 ± 0.06  Hz,  Fig.  5B).  While  vari-
able, within 5–9 h post-release the metrics had declined
to a relatively stable value, mean hourly VeDBA for all fish
combined  plateaued  after  6  h  (± 1.7,  range  4–8  h),  TBA
within 5 h (± 1.5, range 3–7) DSF within 7.4 h (± 2.8 range
4–12 h) and TBP within 8.4 h (± 4.2, range 4–13 h). Simi-
lar patterns of activity were recorded for ABT tagged with
MiniPATs, with mean hourly VeDBA peaking in the first
hour  post-release  for  most  ABT  (0.23 ± 0.09  g;  Fig.  6A,
Supplementary  Fig.  2B),  though  four  fish  had  slightly
elevated mean hourly VeDBA during the third hour post-
release  compared  to  the  first  hour  (0.05 ± 0.04  g).  ABT
activity  declined  and  stabilised  within  6 ± 1.9  h  (range
3–9 h) (Fig. 6A). While MiniPAT and G7 tagged ABT had
similar curved fork length (Welch t-test t = 0.50, p = 0.62),
mean hourly VeDBA was 1.3 times greater for MiniPAT
compared to G7 tagged fish (Supplementary Fig. 2).

30-day behavioural response– activity levels

The  initial  burst  activity  recorded  by  G7  and  Mini-
PAT  tagged  fish  immediately  post-release  was  followed
by  a  period  of  very  low  activity  (lower  than  95%  of  all
VeDBA data) compared to that observed over the annual
cycle.  Low  activity  occurred  from  8  h  post-release  (max
onset  21  h),  with  the  lowest  mean  hourly  VeDBA  value
recorded across the entire 12-month deployment period
(for  MiniPAT  fish;  Fig.  6B).  In  the  first  24  h  of  deploy-
ment,  mean  hourly  VeDBA  values  fell  within  the  lowest
5th percentile of all mean hourly VeDBA recorded across

ABT’s full deployments, for an average of 13 ± 10 h, with
reduced and dissimilar patterns activity lasting from 2 to
26 days (mean: 11 ± 7.9 days, Figs. 7 and 8). Seven out of
12 ABT (18P0812, 18P0837, 19P0137, 19P0206, 20P0084,
20P1136,  20P1137)  exhibited  irregular  activity  for  more
than  a  week  post-tagging,  with  no  evidence  of  diel  pat-
terns  of  behaviour  (Figs.  2  and  8;  Table  2),  while  three
(16P2365,  17P1004,  18P0932)  exhibited  consistent  diel
activity within four days (Table 2, Supplementary Figs. 4
& 5). Across all MiniPAT tagged ABT, low daily similar-
ity  value  ranks  were  recorded  in  the  initial  days  follow-
ing  release,  with  the  first  two  days  post-release  being
the most dissimilar days in four of the 12 fish (Table 2).
Following  this  period  of  reduced  activity,  fish  increased

activity  at  different  rates  (Figs.  2,  7,  Supplementary
Fig. 5).

There  was  no  relationship  between  fight  time  or  fish
length or weight on when diurnal activity resumed (fight
time  linear  regression:  R2 = 0.03,  p = 0.61;  fish  length
R2 = 0.21  p = 0.13;  weight:  R2 = 0.22  p = 0.13).  Water  tem-
perature at capture also didn’t explain the period of time
to  exhibit  diel  vertical  migration  (hereafter  DVM)  (lin-
ear  regression:  R2 = 0.51,  p = 0.49),  and  though  the  tim-
ing  of  DVM  patterns  coincided  with  the  new  moon  for
six  of  the  12  ABT,  this  may  be  an  artefact  of  when  tag-
ging  occurred,  as  seven  out  of  12  fish  were  tagged  dur-
ing the waning moon, and an additional four fish during
the new moon. Mean activity remained similar regardless

of moon phase in the first 30 days post-release (Kruskal-
Wallis rank sum test, X2 = 0.66, df = 3, p = 0.88).

30-day behavioural response– depth use

In contrast to reduced activity patterns, only four Mini-
PAT tagged ABT showed dissimilar patterns of depth use
following release (Table 3; Fig. 3). The return of diel depth
use in these individuals coincided with a change in their
location (and thus the underlying mean bathymetry from
104 ± 15 m to 2,669 ± 948 m), and occurred during differ-
ent lunar phases. For eight fish, depth use remained simi-
lar  regardless  of  lunar  phase  (Kruskal-Wallis  rank  sum
test,  X2 = 3.93,  df = 3,  p = 0.27)  and  was  generally  better

described  by  the  underlying  bathymetry,  constraining
dives (Fig. 3). For example, ABT that experienced a nar-
row depth range and little variation in mean bathymetry
throughout  the  first  month  of  deployment  maintained
similar patterns of depth use throughout the first 30 days
(Fig.  3,  fish  IDs:  18P0837,  19P0137,  20P1136,  20P1136,
21P0468).  Overall,  across  the  first  30  days,  ABT  swam
shallower at night than during the day (GLMM: t2= -2.49,
p = 0.01;  day:  24.5 ± 34.6  m,  night:  20.6 ± 17.6  m).  How-
ever,  depth  use  remained  similar  regardless  of  whether
ABT  were  undergoing  directed  or  localised  movements
as  determined  by  the  HMM  (GLMM:  t2=-1.63,  p = 0.10;
directed  movement:  22.9 ± 29.5  m,  localised  movement:

21.5 ± 20.2 m), and there was no interaction between time
of day and movement state (GLMM: t2=-1.67, p = 0.10).

Measuring fast starts (potential foraging events) and
behavioural influences of tagging

ABT varied in the amount of time they allocated per day
to  fast  starts.  Inactive  days,  defined  as  those  when  fish
spent < 1% of their time performing fast starts, occurred
on average for 6.2 ± 1.3 days of the first week post-release
(88%  of  the  week,  range  4–7  days;  Fig.  4B).  By  week  4,
inactive  days  occurred  on  4.3 ± 2.5  days  of  each  week
(61% of the week). Overall, in the first 30 days, fish spent
0.76 ± 1.54%  of  each  day  performing  fast  starts.  This

varied  between  fish  (e.g.  fish  20P0084  allocated  14.9%,
while  fish  20P1137  allocated  0.3%;  Fig.  4A).  In  contrast,
in the last 30 days of deployment ABT were much more
active,  allocating < 1%  of  each  day  to  fast  starts  for  only
2.7 ± 2.1  days  of  weeks  1  and  4  respectively  (Fig.  4E-F,
Supplementary Figs. 6 & 7).

Behaviour 11 months later

For tags deployed for 12 months (n = 6), the last 30 days
of the deployment showed diurnal patterns of behaviour
(Fig.  8B),  with  greater  VeDBA  during  the  day  compared
to  the  night  (Wilcoxon  rank  sum  test,  W = 3.5 × 10^6,

all  during  the  last  30  days  of  deployment  (VeDBA-

mean  hourly  VeDBA  remained  consistently  higher  than
the value that was recorded immediately post-release (red
horizontal line Fig. 6B and D). Although variable, higher
daily similarity values were recorded for all six fish during
the  last  30  days  of  deployment  (Table  2;  Fig.  5S-X).  For
example,  fish  18P0937  and  19P0206  had  daily  similar-
ity  values  that  were  7  and  17  times  greater,  respectively,
than for first 30 days (18P0937: 0.57 ± 0.09 vs. 0.08 ± 0.13;
19P0206:  0.68 ± 0.08  vs.  0.04 ± 0.16).  Depth  use  was
also  far  more  consistent  between  days  and  among  indi-
viduals  during  the  last  30  days  (Table  3,  Supplementary
Fig.  8),  and  across  lunar  phases  (Kruskal-Wallis  rank
sum  test,  X2 = 1.02  df = 3,  p = 0.80).  In  contrast  to  the
first 30 days of deployment, mean bathymetry remained

shallow  throughout  the  last  30  days  of  the  tracking
(mean: 114 ± 80 m; Supplementary Fig. 6) and ABT typi-
cally  swam  significantly  shallower  at  night  than  during
the day.

In  terms  of  spatial  behaviour,  there  were  no  signifi-
cant differences in the distance covered by the ABT dur-
ing  the  first  and  last  30  days  of  deployment  (meanfirst30:

p = 0.32). Similarly, no significant difference was observed
in  the  overall  straightness  index  (SIfirst30  0.39 ± 0.20;  vs.
SIlast30  0.24 ± 0.12,  Welch  t-test,  t = 1.90,  p = 0.08).  How-
ever, ABT displayed an initial flight response in the first
14 days following release (see results section “Behaviour
immediately following tagging”).

Discussion
Atlantic bluefin tuna appear to exhibit a phased response
to  capture,  tag  and  release,  with  a  strong,  highly  active
initial  swimming  response  over  5  to  9  h,  as  reported  in
other  short-term,  post-release  studies  of  large  fish  [15,
44, 45, 57, 65, 66]. This initial response is followed, how-
ever, by a period of significantly reduced activity, lacking
diel behaviour patterns, lasting from 2 to 26 days (mean
11 ± 7.9  days)  before  consistent  behaviour  and  activity
were re-established. This has not been shown before and
has importance both for the treatment of biologging data,
and the welfare of large fish during capture and tagging.

Behaviour immediately following tagging

In  the  present  study,  ABT  activity,  tailbeat  amplitude
and frequency were 2.4, 3.2 and 1.4 times greater respec-
tively  in  the  first  hour  post-release  than  the  subsequent
24-hours (Fig. 2). This is comparable to previous findings

in ABT, where tailbeat frequencies were higher and sus-
tained  in  the  first  hour  post-release,  before  plateauing
within 5–10 h [44, 45]. In the current study, mean hourly
VeDBA  values  were  on  average  1.3  times  greater  for
MiniPAT  compared  to  G7-tagged  ABT,  which  we  sug-
gest  is  likely  due  to  the  tag  anchoring  system.  G7  tags
were anchored front and aft to reduce tag wobble, result-
ing in lower standard deviations for mean hourly VeDBA
compared  to  the  MiniPAT  tags,  which  were  anchored
front  and  centre. This  difference  in  anchoring  may  have
resulted  in  the  MiniPAT  moving  more  on  the  fish,  and
contributing  to  the  greater  variability  and  differences  in
hourly mean VeDBA (Fig. 6A).

The  process  of  capture  for  large  fish  is  significant,  as
fish are often fought to the point that they can no longer
overcome  the  resistance  of  the  fishing  gear.  Burst  activ-
ity  during  the  fight  is  most  likely  powered  by  anaero-
bic  metabolism,  accumulating  metabolic  end-products

Fig. 7  Density distribution of activity by ABT for the first 30 days of deployment. Ridgeline plots of the density distribution of hourly mean VeDBA for the
first 30 days following release for all 12 MiniPAT tagged fish. ABT all began with small VeDBA distribution in the first day following release, which increased
over time, except for 18P0837, which expended the highest activity in the first two days post-release

such  as  lactate  and  cortisol,  and  decreasing  blood  pH
[11,  67–70].  During  this  period,  fish  can  incur  hooking
injuries  [41,  71,  72],  and  capture  may  also  elicit  other
physiological  stress  responses  [69,  73].  The  effects  of
the  tagging  process,  from  air  exposure  during  board-
ing  the  fish,  to  biological  sampling  and  tag  incision,
will also have an impact on the ABT [69, 74, 75]. Given
these  impacts,  fight  times  and  short  handling  durations
(mean 2.6 ± 0.5 min) were minimised in the current study.
ABT  were  irrigated  whilst  on  deck,  and  ventilation  was
assisted  through  reoxygenation  tows  following  assess-
ment  for  fitness  for  tagging  and  release.  It  is  important
to  point  out  that  while  there  can  be  sub-lethal  impacts
of tagging on ABT, this study recorded zero mortalities,
consistent with post-release mortalities reported for ABT
[58] and Pacific bluefin tuna (Thunnus orientalis, hereaf-
ter PBT) [3, 37, 41–43, 46, 70, 76].

Based on physiological studies of fish, the post-release
recovery phase encompasses restoration of homeostasis,
including  replenishment  of  oxygen  and  glycogen  stores,
and  removal  of  excess  blood  lactate  [67,  77]  which  may
take  long  periods  of  time  [69].  For  example,  fish  cor-
tisol  levels  are  generally  thought  to  peak  within  1–2  h

following  intense  activity,  and  the  recovery  of  muscle
lactate  and  glycogen  can  take  up  to  12  h,  depending  on
the species [67, 78, 79]. This might be aided by swimming
faster for some portion of the recovery period, as shown
in blue marlin (Makaira nigricans) and sailfish (Istiopho-
rus  platypterus)  [55,  57],  ten  ram-ventilating  shark  spe-
cies and ABT [16], and by the initial prolonged dive and
rapid  dominant  stroke  frequencies  (Fig.  2C)  made  by
tuna in the present study. These dives may be associated
with increasing oxygen intake but perhaps might also aid
in thermoregulation. Blue marlin, for example, may gain
up to 2.1° C following a 15-minute fight on rod and reel
[55]. Thus, ABT in the present study may have also been
diving to cool down following capture. Muscle tempera-
tures as high as 29.4 °C have been reported in small PBT
following capture, which dropped by 5 °C within 40 min
of  release  [80].  While  speed  was  not  measured  in  the
present  study,  a  relationship  between  tailbeat  frequency
and speed has previously been directly recorded in ABT
carrying  biologging  tags  that  included  speedometers,
accelerometers  and  depth  sensors  [45].  The  direct  ener-
getic cost of swimming at faster speeds following release

six ABT tracked for a year, for the first (left column) and last (right column) 30 days of the deployment. ABT 17P1004 was excluded from the depth analysis
for the last 30 days of the deployment as the depth sensor became faulty before the end of the tracking duration. Colours represent significant differences
in behaviour during night and day (see legend, right), and white colouration where there was no significant difference

has  been  estimated  to  make  up  to  47%  (± 9%)  of  ABTs
daily energy expenditure [16].

Behaviour post 24-hours

It is generally accepted that the first 5–10 h post-release
are  influenced  by  a  stress  response  to  capture,  handling
and/or  tagging  [16,  45,  81,  82],  but  biologging  data  fol-
lowing  this  are  generally  considered  to  represent  “nor-
mal”  behaviour.  Instead,  we  show  that  ABT  exhibit  a
subdued activity state with loss of diel behaviour, lasting
between 2 and 26 days (on average 11 days) (Figs. 3B and
5), with the duration and the magnitude of this response
varying  between  individuals  (Fig.  6).  This  includes  the
proportion  of  time  allocated  to  fast  starts  (Fig.  4A-C),
which  may  represent  a  variety  of  behaviours  in  ABT,
including  feeding. This  reduction  in  overall  activity  may
be because the ABT spent more time than normal mak-
ing directed migration movements in the first two weeks
post-release,  and  therefore  did  not  exhibit  the  usual
activity  associated  with  foraging.  Further  work  using

internal  archival  tags  to  monitor  foraging  and  accelera-
tion  simultaneously,  as  has  been  done  in  captive  ABT
(see  [60])  would  help  clarify  this.  Internal  tagging  can
directly measure the heat increment of digestion [61, 83,
84]  and  has  previously  been  used  to  suggest  that  ABT
and PBT can resume foraging within a few days to a week
post-tagging [36, 60, 85, 86]. For example, southern blue-
fin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) resumed feeding on average
19 days after release (range 5–38 days; [87]). The subdued
activity state may also be a response to tagging itself, with
behavioural  changes  associated  with  exposure  to  stress-
ors such as handling and air exposure impacting the pref-
erence or ability to feed [88]. ABT may have taken time to
become  accustomed  to  the  tag  attachment  and  diverted
metabolic  pathways  to  wound  healing  [89].  Short-
term  impairments  in  swimming  performances,  such  as
decreased  critical  swim  speeds  (the  maximum  speed  a
fish  can  maintain,  representing  the  upper  limit  of  aero-
bic  swimming  performance),  slower  tailbeat  frequencies
and reduced aerobic scope, have been observed in several

Rudd et al. Movement Ecology           (2025) 13:37
Page 15 of 19

species with external tags compared to their non-tagged
counterparts  [90,  91].  These  effects  were  attributed  to
increased drag or the tagging procedures [92–94]. Other
studies  have  found  no  significant  differences  in  swim-
ming  performance  between  tagged  and  untagged  fish
[95–97], however, measurements were conducted 24 h to
7  days  post-tagging,  by  which  point  the  initial  response
to tagging may have subsided.

Behaviour 11 months later

In  contrast  to  the  rapid  and  direct  movement  following
tagging  (Fig.  4A),  a  year  later,  four  ABT  were  resident
within  the  English  Channel,  one  was  migrating  back
from the Bay of Biscay to the Channel, and one migrated
away from the Channel to the west coast of Ireland, but
at  a  much  slower  rate  than  movements  recorded  in  the
first  week  post-tagging  (58  km.day− 1  vs.  73  km.day− 1)
(Fig. 4D). The greatest distance travelled always occurred
within the first 24 h of the deployment, and these initial
movements  may  have  been  to  escape  the  capture  and
tagging  location  (a  flight  response  [88]),  and  perhaps  a
period of increased ventilation to facilitate the removal of
metabolic end-products. Black marlin (Istiompax indica)
tagged  in  the  Coral  Sea  were  found  to  exhibit  similar
rapid  movement  up  to  556  km  away  from  their  release
sites  [98].  Sharks  (eight  different  species)  also  appeared
to  swim  offshore  to  deeper  water  following  capture,
although  displacement  distances  varied  between  species
[99].  However,  in  other  ABT  and  PBT  studies,  shorter
displacement  distances  were  recorded  after  release  [42,
70,  100,  101]  with  fish  remaining  in  the  vicinity  of  the
release locations [102], particularly in smaller individuals
[103].  In  the  present  study,  directed  movements  appear
to  be  either  too  early  in  the  year  to  be  characterised  as
part  of  the  general  migratory  cycle  or  too  large  to  be
characterised  as  day-to-day  dispersal  between  feeding
areas while resident in the English Channel based on data
from  individuals  tracked  from  the  English  Channel  for
over  a  year  (481–708  days)  [58].  However,  further  work
is  required  to  define  the  extent  and  nature  of  any  post-
tagging escape response.

Almost a year after capture, ABT in the present study
returned to the same waters and exhibited relatively con-
sistent diel vertical migration in shallow (< 200 m) waters
(Fig.  4D,  Supplementary  Fig.  8).  In  contrast,  in  the  first
30  days  post-release,  five  of  the  12  ABT  remained  in
shelf  waters  but  did  not  show  any  diel  diving  behaviour
(Fig.  5,  Supplementary  Fig.  4).  Similarly,  ABT  tracked
from  the  western  Atlantic  also  showed  no  diel  vertical
migration following release [36, 104, 105] perhaps, as in
the present study, because they were released over shal-
low  shelf  regions  (~ 20  m  depth  to  the  bottom  [36,  100,
104]). Depth use remained similar across the lunar cycle
(Fig. 3), which was perhaps surprising as the lunar cycle’s

influence  on  depth  use  has  been  observed  in  PBT  [106,
107],  Southern  bluefin  tuna  [87]  as  well  as  ABT  [100,
101].  Instead,  differences  in  the  period  of  behavioural
disruption may be attributed to factors such as maturity,
time since feeding, and intrinsic physiological differences
between individuals [15, 108].

Thus,  each  capture  event  has  its  own  conditions  that
begin  with  how  the  fish  are  captured,  how  long  they
are handled for, and how they are tagged, which may all
impact  recovery  differently.  The  duration  of  the  post-
release  response  may  be  proportional  to  the  magnitude
of  the  stressors  [67]  and  linked  to  fish  size,  with  larger
fish exhibiting more prolonged responses to capture and
tagging  [70].  This  may  be  due  to  larger  fish  taking  gen-
erally  longer  to  land,  increasing  the  relative  cost  of  the
fight [67]. However, this did not appear to be the case in
the present study, nor in blue marlin, sailfish, and greater
amberjack (Seriola dumerili) [19, 57]. The intensity of the
fight may be a more important factor than fight duration,
although making an objective measure of ‘fight intensity’
is extremely challenging. Future work may include fishing
gear  fitted  with  accelerometers  to  measure  the  intensity
of capture events [13, 109]. ABT in the current study may
have  recovered  more  quickly  from  the  physical  exercise
associated with capture than the time required to adjust
to tagging. Electronically tagged ABT have high survival
rates [8, 41, 46] are known to resume feeding within days
following  tagging  [60,  86,  110]  and  perform  important
life history events such as spawning whilst tagged [39, 47,
48].

Challenges in defining recovery

A key challenge in biologging is understanding when the
host  animal  is  likely  to  exhibit  behaviour  that  is  repre-
sentative of the broader, untagged population. Removing
the  ‘tagging  artefact’  from  data  is  essential,  yet  metrics
used  to  define  the  duration  of  the  post-release  period
are  highly  variable  [15,  111–113],  ranging  from  physi-
ological  markers  [69,  70],  metabolic  activity  [114]  and
behaviour [19, 56, 57], which may all be influenced by the
duration and resolution of measurement [30, 79]. While
approaches  such  as  recapturing  tagged  individuals  [115,
116] can help to isolate the effect of capture and tagging,
this  method  may  not  be  feasible  for  highly  mobile  spe-
cies  where  recapture  rates  are  low.  In  the  present  study,
we found that return to baseline behaviour was variable
between  individuals,  with  post-release  behaviour  being
altered for several days, and in some cases weeks, rather
than  hours.  In  several  bluefin  tuna  studies,  the  first  1–6
days have been discarded to allow for the fact that feed-
ing  or  behaviour  may  be  altered  immediately  after  cap-
ture  and  tagging  [61,  84,  106],  though  several  studies
with  implanted  archival  tags  revealed  rapid  return  to
feeding  within  days  of  tagging  [60,  83,  86]  highlighting

Rudd et al. Movement Ecology           (2025) 13:37 the  differences  in  response  to  capture  and  tagging  even
within species. In the present study, these patterns were
influenced not only by time since release, but also by fac-
tors such as fight time, fish size and possible tag burden.
Here  we  suggest  that  short-term  deployments  (i.e.  less
than a week) may fail to capture unaffected behaviour in
some cases [19]. Our results highlight the value of com-
bining long-term deployments in tandem with high-res-
olution  tags  to  identify  and  quantify  short-term  effects
that may otherwise be missed.

Impacts of capture and tagging

The results here suggest that ABT may have a more com-
plex response to capture, tagging and release than previ-
ously  considered  [17,  117].  Minimising  interaction  [69,
70, 102] is probably sensible, as ABT increased the dura-
tion of their initial recovery dive by 4 min with each addi-
tional minute fighting the line, though fight time did not
predict  when  the  fish  would  resume  diurnal  behaviour.
This may be due to issues beyond the present study, such
as  inflammation,  discomfort  and  what  fish  may  experi-
ence  as  pain  from  the  intra-muscular  tag  darts  or  bio-
logical sampling (fin clip and muscle biopsy). Local tissue
damage  associated  with  insertion  of  internal  darts  have
been  reported  in  different  tag  attachment  methods  [74,
75], and wound healing can be delayed when fish are sub-
jected to other stressors [118]. Nociception has been seen
to affect behaviour in fish including delay in reception of
feeding  and  loss  of  equilibrium  [119].  Local  analgesics
can block nociception in fish [120, 121], thus future work
could investigate the effect of tagging itself and whether
the use of local analgesics may reduce the impacts of tag-
ging in ABT.

Conclusion
In  summary,  the  impacts  of  capture,  handling  and  tag-
ging  on  ABT  have  probably  been  generally  underesti-
mated owing to limits on the length of many studies, yet
we  show  that  the  effects  of  capture  may  extend  from  at
least days to several weeks before ABT resume “normal”
behaviour.  The  drivers  of  this  remain  unclear  and  com-
plex,  with  likely  interactions  between  fight  times  and
intensity,  handling,  as  well  as  response  to  tagging  and
wound healing. Additional factors including fishing gear,
angler  experience,  tag  attachment  time,  whether  fish
were  boarded,  abiotic  conditions  (such  as  temperature,
dissolved  oxygen  and  bathymetry)  and  condition  of  fish
prior to capture may also have an influence. Further long-
term studies may reveal if this is also the case in different
species, with important implications from ethics to data
analysis, and eventually effective stock management.
