Twelve ocean sunﬁsh, Mola mola, were tagged with pop-up satellite archival tags off the coast of Kamogawa,
Japan during the spring of 2001 and 2003–2006. Transmitted data were obtained from seven tags. An eighth
tag was recovered and provided a highly detailed four-month dataset from which several recognizable
diving patterns emerged. This M. mola spent considerable time at the surface, possibly warming itself. These
apparent basking events were punctuated by regular deep dives below the thermocline to depths as great as
600 m and temperatures as low as 2 °C. The vast majority of dives occurred during the day, with relatively
little vertical movement at night. Geolocation estimates were possible between tag and release for ﬁve
individuals. No large, basin-scale movements were apparent with most molas remaining relatively close to
their initial tagging location over a six to nine month period. Seasonal movements were apparent for some
molas and corresponded to regional shifts in oceanography. Northward movements from the Kuroshio
Current into the Kuroshio–Oyashio transition zone and the Oyashio Current during the summer months
coincided with an increase in temperature and reduction in chlorophyll a concentrations in waters near
central Japan. In the fall, most molas returned inshore to the coast of Japan. Molas are targeted and
incidentally captured by ﬁshermen in these waters, and the information presented here is vital for effective
ﬁsheries management and to forecast changes in mola behaviors associated with environmental variability.

1. Introduction

Ocean sunﬁsh [Mola mola (Linnaeus, 1758)] are found in all tropical
and temperate ocean basins and are the world's heaviest bony ﬁsh,
reaching more than 2200 kg (Carwardine, 1995; Roach, 2003).
According to fossil evidence, the family Molidae diverged from their
puffer ﬁsh relatives approximately 40 million years ago, abandoned life
on the reef, and took to the open sea (Tyler and Bannikov, 1992; Tyler
and Santini, 2002). Currently, three species are recognized (Nelson,

1994), all of which lack a true tail (Bigelow and Welsh, 1924; Fraser-
Brunner, 1951; McCann, 1961): M. mola (common mola), Masturus
lanceolatus (Liénard 1840) (sharp tailed mola) and Ranzania laevis
(Pennant 1776) (slender mola). The English common name of the
group, ocean sunﬁsh, stems from the ﬁsh's characteristic behavior of
lying at the sea surface, apparently basking (Norman and Fraser, 1938).
Molas forage near the base of the food web like most of the largest
whales, sharks, and rays. They may consume krill and other
crustaceans (Aﬂalo, 1904), but their primary food source appears to
be a mixed assemblage of gelatinous zooplankton, referred to here as
jellies (Fraser-Brunner, 1951). One of the few large pelagic organisms
that share this unique trophic niche is the leatherback sea turtle, the
largest of the extant marine turtles. Jellies comprise one of the most
dominant yet poorly understood assemblages of pelagic fauna (Mills,

1995; Mills, 2001), and their global abundance and distribution may
be changing due to a number of factors including climate change,
pollution, and overﬁshing, (Brodeur et al., 1999; Purcell et al., 2007;
Richardson et al., 2009). In turn, the changes in the abundance and
distribution of jellies may be impacting the organisms that rely on
them, such as the mola.

While general distribution patterns are known, information on the
movements of M. mola is based on relatively few studies. In 2004,
Cartamil and Lowe (2004) reported on the horizontal and vertical
movements of eight acoustically tracked molas off Southern California
for periods ranging from 24 to 72 h. More recently, Hays et al. (2009)
published a study comparing the geographical movements and
vertical tracks of four M. mola to those of leatherback sea turtles
(Dermochelys coriacea) off Capetown, South Africa, with results
supporting the claim that molas are deep divers (Norman and Fraser,
1938; Wheeler, 1969). In a similar study, Sims et al. (2009) provided
evidence for seasonal migration of three M. mola in the northeast
Atlantic, and highly variable dive patterns. These studies suggest that
molas likely alter their vertical behavior in response to environmental
conditions and prey distribution (Hays et al., 2009; Sims et al., 2009).
While research to date has provided important insights into their
geographic and vertical habitat use, previous studies have been limited
in time, space, and/or sample size and there is currently no information
available for the western Paciﬁc where molas are captured in ﬁsheries.
Although caught and sold in only a few locations worldwide, such
as Japan and Taiwan, M. mola are taken incidentally in a large number
of ﬁsheries. They are the most common bycatch of the broadbill
swordﬁsh drift gillnet ﬁshery off California and Oregon. According to
reports from the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Southwest
Region, between 1990 and 1998, 26.1% of the drift net catch consisted
of M. mola. This translates to a catch of more than 26,000 individuals
(Rand Rasmussen, NMFS Southwest Fisheries Science Center, pers.
comm.). In the Mediterranean, M. mola constitute up to 90% of the
catch of the illegal Spanish driftnet swordﬁsh ﬁshery off the Gibraltar
Straits (Silvani et al., 1999). Off the coast of South Africa, ocean sunﬁsh
bycatch rates from the tuna and swordﬁsh longline ﬁshery are
estimated at 340,000 sunﬁsh annually (Petersen, 2005; Sims et al.,
2009). Unfortunately, without even crude estimates of the population
structure, connectivity, or size, the impact of these ﬁsheries is difﬁcult
to assess. Also, while molas are considered to be highly fecund
(Fraser-Brunner, 1951), recruitment is unknown.

As mentioned above, one location where molas are captured for
food is in the western Paciﬁc off the east coast of Japan. Known as
‘manbou’, molas occupy a special place in Japanese culture. From
being a tax payment to shoguns in the 17th and 18th centuries
(Jingushicho, 1910) to becoming modern day town mascots (e.g. the
town of Kamogawa) and the focus of ecotourism, molas have been

revered and consumed in Japan for centuries. Currently, genetic and
pop-up satellite telemetry data are being collected for M. mola to
document movements, behaviors, population subdivision, and mi-
gratory rates and routes around the Paciﬁc. Our objectives for this
study were to examine the horizontal and vertical movements of
molas in the western Paciﬁc and relate changes in those patterns to
changes in environmental parameters. Results are presented from
satellite tagging efforts on M. mola off Japan in the spring of 2001 and
2003–2006.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Pop-up satellite archival tags

The pop-up satellite archival tag (PSAT, Model PAT2, PAT3, PAT4 and
Mk10, Wildlife Computers, Redmond, Washington USA) (Block et al.,
1998; Lutcavage et al., 1999; Sedberry and Loefer, 2001) was used in this
study. The precision of temperature measurements was 0.1 °C between
12 and 26.95 °C and for values outside this range was 0.2 °C. The
precision in depth measurements was depth dependent and measured
within 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 m over ranges from −20 to 99.5, 100 to 199.5,
200 to 299.5, 300 to 499.5, and 500 to 979.5 m, respectively. Histograms
and temperature/depth proﬁles (PDT's) were set at either 12- or 24-h
intervals. Light intensity measurements, coupled with the internal clock,
document the times of dawn and dusk and allow for calculation of local
noon or midnight and subsequently longitude (Hill, 1994) using
software provided by the tag manufacturer (WC-GPE v1.02.0005,
Wildlife Computers). Latitude is determined using longitude and sea
surface temperature (SST) transmitted by the PSAT (Teo et al., 2004).
The SST reported by the tag is matched along the line of longitude to the
SST obtained from satellite imagery. Root mean squared error estimates
from previous studies are approximately ±0.5˚ for longitude and less
than 2˚ for SST based latitudes (Hill and Braun, 2001; Musyl et al., 2001;
Teo et al., 2004).

The PSAT has numerous safeguards to reduce non-reporting rates.
If the tag remains at the surface or at a constant depth for a user-
deﬁned period, internal software signals the tag to release and initiate
transmission. To prevent implosion at depth, a special device, the
RD1500 (Wildlife Computers), severs the leader at 1500 m, releasing
the tag.

2.2. Tagging

A total of 12 tags were deployed on M. mola off Kamogawa, Japan
during April of 2001 (n = 3), 2003 (n = 2), 2004 (n = 3), 2005 (n = 2)
and March 2006 (n = 2) (Table 1, Fig. 1). All molas were captured in
set nets (stationary rectangular traps consisting of anchored netting)

a few kilometers offshore. Four individuals were held at Kamogawa
Sea World for a period ranging from 4 to 25 days prior to tagging and
release. The remaining molas were tagged and released on the day of
capture. The molas were placed in a live well on a boat, measured, and
tagged at the base of their dorsal ﬁn prior to release. Tags were
secured using large nylon darts, which were attached to the tags using
300-lb test monoﬁlament line and stainless steel crimps. A small
tissue sample was taken from the pectoral ﬁn for genetic analysis.
Following tagging, the boat transported the molas offshore where
they were all released at approximately the same location (Table 1).
Tags were programmed to release after periods ranging from 6 to
12 months.

2.3. Data analysis

To examine the day/night differences in temperature and depth,
the data from the recovered tag (no. 795) were separated using the
light level curves showing the time of sunrise and sunset. The
crepuscular periods during which light changed rapidly were
excluded from the analysis. Data from the archival tag was combined
with that obtained from tags 63 and 64 that transmitted more than

10 days of data and had 12-h bin intervals set to collect primarily
daytime and nighttime periods. The remaining tags either transmitted
insufﬁcient data (n = 4) or the timing of the bins (n = 1) did not allow
for the examination of day–night patterns. The approximate depth of
the mixed layer (the depth at which the dramatic decrease in
temperature initiated) for mola 795 was calculated from the archival
record by examining temperature at depth using only the data
collected on the descent. Earlier models of the PSAT tag had a thermal
lag. This approach provides a conservative estimate of the mixed layer
depth. Seasons were deﬁned according to the astronomical calendar.
Geolocations of molas over 10-day periods were plotted over
10-day averaged composites of sea surface temperature (SST) (MODIS,
<http://podaac-www.jpl.nasa.gov/>) and chlorophyll a (SeaWiFS, http://
oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/) during the same period. This allowed us to
examine the associations, if any, between the movements of the molas
with changes in SST and chlorophyll a concentration.

3. Results

Data were collected from the eight of the 12 tags deployed
(Table 1). Tag 795 was recovered by a set-net ﬁsherman in the

Shiranuka Aomori Prefecture in northern Japan. Prior to the battery
failing, 110 days of temperature, depth and light level data at two
minute intervals were obtained. Of the remaining seven tags, two
released early and all transmitted limited amounts of data. Tag 758
released when the ﬁsh went below 980 m (the depth limit of the tag),
presumably triggering the RD1500 and severing the monoﬁlament
leader. Tag 833 transmitted minimal light level data and a single
temperature histogram. Tag 63 transmitted between 26 and 53 out of
a possible 394 temperature/depth summaries (PDT's or temperature
or depth histograms). Tag 64 transmitted between 41 and 73 of a
possible 398 temperature/depth summaries. Tag 291 transmitted only
two to four temperature/depth summaries (all collected at night) out
of a possible 494. Tag 41 provided only a pop-up location. The ﬁnal tag
288 transmitted between 43 and 64 temperature/depth summaries
out of a possible 386.

3.1. Geolocation

The movements of eight molas after release were based both on
the pop-up location obtained from Argos (Argos, 1989) and the light
and SST-based geolocation estimates when possible (Fig. 1). Given the
short duration of the track, only the release and pop-up locations for
tag 758 were used. For tag 833, it was only possible to estimate
longitudes between tag and release because no SST data were
transmitted, and for tag 41 only the pop-up location was obtained.
For tags 795, 63, 64, 291 and 288, latitudes and longitudes between
the release and pop-up locations were calculated.

A pattern of seasonal movements was evident by examining some
of the longer tracks, although some variability among individuals was
apparent (Fig. 1). Following their release in the spring, all molas for
which tracks were available moved northeast, north of the Kuroshio
Current and into the Kuroshio–Oyashio transition zone (KOTZ) and
the southern reaches of the Oyashio Current, where they remained for
much of the summer. The locations, recorded SSTs and mixed layer
temperature and depth are consistent with the known characteristics
of these two currents (Fig. 4) (Kawai, 1969; Sakurai, 2007). In the late
summer, most ﬁsh moved back towards Japan, and in the fall ﬁve ﬁsh
were near the coast. This includes tags 795 and 41 that were
recovered or popped up near the coast in October (Fig. 1A and F).
Molas 63 and 64 moved south along the coast of Japan until their pop-
up date on November 1 (Fig. 1B and C). While ﬁsh 288 showed a
similar seasonal pattern through the spring and much of the summer,
it did not return towards Japan in late summer and continued to
progress towards the east until the tag popped up in late September
(Fig. 1E). Two molas moved east into the Kuroshio extension. While
mola 291 spent the summer north of the Kuroshio Current, similar to
the other molas, it was ∼ 1700 km east of its tagging location at 158˚E
on its January pop-up date (Fig. 1D). Data between August and
December were not recovered. The longitude estimates for mola 833
reveal that by early September, when the ﬁve molas were near Japan,
this individual had reached its most easterly position at 161˚E. It
appeared to be returning towards the west when the tag released at
151.04˚E in mid October. Mola 758 had moved over 1000 km east
when the tag popped up after two weeks.

Remote sensing satellite data allowed for the examination of
movements in relation to SST and chlorophyll a levels, which provided
a proxy for primary productivity (Fig. 2). Movements north
corresponded to an increase in SST and a decrease in chlorophyll a
levels off central Japan. At the same time, the temperature increased
in the cooler KOTZ and Oyashio Current, and while overall chlorophyll
a concentrations also dropped in this region, they were still higher
than off central Japan. Satellite-derived chlorophyll a concentrations
along the best track (mola 795) ranged from 0.2 to 3.1 mg m− 3 with
80% of values falling between 0.3 and 1 mg m− 3. These values are not
precise due to the errors associated with light- and SST-based
geolocation estimates.

3.2. Temperature and depth

Analyses of temperature and depth data were conducted for those
molas (795, 758, 64, 63 and 288) whose tags reported 10 or more
temperature or depth records (histograms or PDTs). Depth and
temperature data provide the opportunity to examine the habitat,
behavior and potential condition of the ﬁsh following tagging.

The general temperature and depth patterns were consistent
across ﬁsh with the exception of mola 758. This individual spent the
majority of its time (63%) below 20 m. While it did come to the
surface each day, as indicated by 0 m minimum depth measurements,
mola 758 spent only 14% of its time in the top 5 m. After two weeks it
either sank or dove to 1500 m, when the tag released. This depth is
over twice the maximum recorded for the other molas in this study.
Mola 758 may not have recovered from tagging and was a possible
mortality (see below). Given the questionable condition of this ﬁsh
and short record, it is not included in subsequent analysis.

The most detailed information on diving behavior comes from the
archival record (mola 795). This mola showed a consistent diel dive
pattern with relatively shallow depths observed at night (Fig. 3) and
deep repetitive dives during the day. Nighttime depths were generally
in the top 5 m. Daytime dives ranged from 27 to 300 m and were
typically punctuated by regular surface intervals. Often there was a
gradual shift in depth at the beginning and end of the day. The general
diel pattern was observed for the entire record except for two days
when the two deepest dives were observed. Interestingly, the deepest
dive to 644 m occurred near local midnight where the mola remained
deep for 8 min. The second deepest dive was to 300 m and occurred
near dawn.

While the diel pattern was consistent across the record, a shift in
the pattern of dives was observed as the ﬁsh progressed towards the
northeast (Fig. 3). For example on April 23, the mola made 12 dives to
between ∼100 and 200 m and 11 and15 °C with ∼1 h spent below the
mixed layer on each dive (Fig. 3A). Later in the record, on August 22,
the mola made more dives (43) below the mixed layer for shorter
durations (∼ 15 min) (Fig. 3B). Typical depths were 40 m and
temperatures were between ∼5 and 10 °C. While SST was similar on
both days, depth of the mixed layer shoaled from around 60 to 20 m,
with much cooler temperatures at depth (e.g. April 23 15 °C at
∼100 m, August 22 15 °C at ∼30 m). The pattern over the entire
record for mola 795 (Fig. 4) as well as for three other molas (Fig. 5)
shows the same reduction in both dive depth and temperatures as the
ﬁsh moved north of the Kuroshio Current. Towards the end of the
record, the SST was higher for the two ﬁsh that returned to Japan in
the fall (tags 63 and 64) than for the one ﬁsh (tag 288) that was still
offshore in September.

Combining data for all tags provided insight into the range of
temperatures and depths experienced by M. mola off Japan from
March through October (Table 2). The minimum dive depth for a
given interval was always 0 m. The overall maximum depths for
individual molas ranged from 296 to 644 m. While 644-m dives were
recorded for two ﬁsh, these deep dives were anomalous and the
average maximum daily depth ranged from 95 to 171 m. The
minimum temperatures encountered at depth were similar, approx-
imately 2 °C. Maximum temperature, which corresponds to SST,
varied more than 16 °C, ranging from 11.3 to 27.8 °C. However, 86% of
the time, SST fell between 13 and 21 °C (Fig. 6).

Temperature and depth histograms combined for three ﬁsh (nos.
795, 63 and 64) (Fig. 7) reﬂect the diel pattern (see Fig. 3) with deeper
depths and cooler temperatures during the day. Based on the bimodal
distribution, the majority of daytime dives were below 100 m.
Assigning actual values to time spent in different bins day and night
was not possible with the 12-h histogram intervals, as some daytime
behavior was included in the nighttime bins and visa versa.
Combining day and night bins, the ﬁsh spent approximately 70% of
their time between 13 and 21 °C and shallower than 50 m, with 50% of

largest satellite tagging study to date and provides the ﬁrst data on
geographic and vertical movement patterns of M. mola in the western
Paciﬁc.

4. Discussion

The data obtained from satellite tagging M. mola in Japanese
waters provide new insight into this poorly understood ﬁsh. The only
detailed information on behaviors of this globally distributed species
comes from one acoustic telemetry study of eight individuals
(Cartamil and Lowe, 2004) and two satellite-tagging studies totaling

While it is clear, given the long deployments, that seven of the
eight molas survived the tagging process, the fate of no. 758 was
uncertain. Unlike the other molas that remained predominantly in
surface waters, this animal spent most of its two-week track in waters
deeper than 20 m and made one ﬁnal descent deeper than 1500 m.
Although there is insufﬁcient baseline information to determine

whether this behavior is abnormal, it is contrary to the general pattern
seen for the other tagged molas in this study and those of Cartamil and
Lowe (2004) and Hays et al. (2009). Shifts in vertical behavior are
common in ﬁsh stressed by tagging (Gunn and Block, 2001; Arnold
and Dewar, 2001), and it is possible that mola 758 did not recover
from the capture and tagging event. Interestingly, the one M. mola that
Sims et al. (2009) reported as a likely mortality also spent
considerably more time below surface waters than the other molas
tagged in that study.

While PSATs are a valuable tool for studying the movements and
behaviors of pelagic organisms (Arnold and Dewar, 2001; Block et al.,
2001; Musyl et al., 2004), the transmission of data in this study was
poor; only limited temperature and depth data were transmitted even
when different tag models were used. While it is not possible to
determine the exact reason for this poor performance, the deployment
durations were relatively long, which can increase failure rates. For
example, biofouling can impact the clearance of the antennae and
quality of data transmission and has been identiﬁed as a problem with
other types of satellite tag (Hays et al., 2007). The tags were painted
with anti-fouling paint, but it is unlikely that the paint lasted for the
duration of the longer deployments. Hardware and software failures
also become more likely with increased deployment duration.

4.2. Geographic movements

Historically, molas have been classiﬁed as large plankton, drifting
passively with the currents (McCann, 1961; Holt, 1965; Lee, 1986). The
ﬁndings from this paper counter this hypothesis, since the sunﬁsh off
Japan did not move with the prevailing currents. For example, the molas
moved out of the Kuroshio Current and into the KOTZ and the southern
edge of the Oyashio Current, not moving with either of these major
currents. Similarly, M. mola tracked in the northeast Atlantic and off
South Africa moved against general current patterns (Sims et al., 2009;
Hays et al., 2009). These data reveal that molas can actively migrate into
different water masses and consequently respond to changes in
oceanography and/or prey availability.

The movements observed off Japan indicated that some molas
make migrations (at least over the seasons covered in this study)
corresponding to an increase in temperature and a reduction of
productivity in the Kuroshio Current following the spring bloom
(Fig. 2, Longhurst, 2007). From April to August, 2002, SST near the
tagging location increased from around 14 °C to around 27 °C and the
chlorophyll a concentration dropped. Around this time, the mola left
this area for the more productive waters in the KOTZ and the southern

reached between 3 and 4 years (150–180 cm TL) and spawning is
thought to occur from August to October (Nakatsubo et al., 2007;
Nakatsubo, 2008).

The data obtained in this study provide no indication that M. mola
from Japan are making basin-scale movements or large-scale migra-
tions, at least in the months from March through October. Even no. 833,
which moved past 160˚ E, appeared to be returning towards Japan when
the tag released in January. Relatively small-scale movements were also
observed for molas tagged off both South Africa and in the northeast
Atlantic (Hays et al., 2009; Sims et al., 2009). This limited movement by
molas contrasts with extensive, sometimes basin-wide, movements
seen in leatherback turtles (Hays et al., 2006; Benson et al., 2007; Bailey
et al., 2008) and is interesting given the similar jelly diets of these
species. It has been suggested that the ability of sunﬁsh to exploit deeper
prey might remove the necessity for extended migrations (Hays et al.,
2009), although differences in their reproductive life histories likely also
play a role.

Our ﬁndings on both vertical and geographic movements have
important implications for management of this species. Information on
vertical habitat use in relation to regional oceanography could be used to
reduce bycatch. Geographically, if movements are limited, population
separation within the Paciﬁc is possible. Population structure within the
Paciﬁc has been reported for a range of large pelagic ﬁsh including some
highly migratory tunas, sharks, and billﬁshes (Graves and McDowell,
1994; Reeb et al., 2000; Graves and McDowell, 2003; Block et al., 2005;
Michaud, 2009). If there is a separate stock of M. mola in the western
Paciﬁc, regional over-exploitation could lead to local depletion and loss
of genetic diversity. Given that little is known about the standing stock
size for this species, the probability of local depletion is difﬁcult to
determine. To contribute to management efforts, additional information
on longer-term migrations over a range of life history stages is necessary
to quantify the variability and relative importance of the molas'
migratory patterns and inform stock structure.

4.3. Behaviors and the environment

The habitat of molas off Japan encompasses a broad range of
temperatures and depths. Molas can descended to as deep as 644 m,
expanding the known depth range for this species (S. Earle pers
comm., R and T Kemper, pers comm., T. Thys unpublished data, Sims
et al., 2009; Hays et al., 2009), yet most dives were much shallower and
the majority of time during both day and night was spent in surface
waters. This is similar to reports from other regions (Cartamil and
Lowe, 2004; Sims et al., 2009; Hays et al., 2009). During dives, molas off
Japan encountered the coldest temperatures reported for this species,
demonstrating an impressive thermal tolerance. Diving into very cold
water (0.4 °C) has also been reported for leatherback turtles on their
foraging grounds (James et al., 2006). However, as with sunﬁsh, such
descents into cooler water can only be tolerated for short periods and
only occur where the surface water is much warmer.

The highest temperatures were encountered in surface waters,
which spanned the range of values reported in other areas for this
species. For example, 93% of surface sightings of M. mola in the western
English Channel were in temperatures between 13˚ and 17 °C (Sims and
Southall, 2002). Based on the data from our study, 11 °C likely
represents the lower bound of the SST habitat envelope for relatively
small molas. This is similar to the 8–10 °C and suggested by Sims et al.
(2009) as a limit to lower SST. As indicated by the seasonal move-
ment patterns apparent from this and other studies, SST likely plays a
large role in the abundance and distribution of molas, similar to other
pelagic ﬁsh, mammals, and turtles. Understanding links to SST will
help predict potential distributional shifts associated with climate
change. For example, McMahon and Hays (2006) report a northward
range expansion of the summer foraging grounds of leatherback sea
turtles in association with an increase in SST at higher latitudes.

bars) for tags 795, 63 and 64. The data for 288 are shown in each inset.

reaches of the Oyashio Current. Here, meso-scale eddies and warm-
core rings enhance the regional productivity resulting in a large forage
base for a range of species including anchovy, salmon, mackerel and
skipjack tuna (Minoda, 1989; Yasuda and Kitagawa, 1996). The tracks
that continued into the fall show the mola returning to the waters off
Japan and the Kuroshio Current when there is typically a second
annual peak in productivity (Longhurst, 2007). Better information on
the ﬁne-scale seasonal patterns of abundance and distribution of jellies
is needed to accurately deﬁne the links between the molas, their prey,
and regional oceanography.

While there are few comparative data available, movements to
higher latitudes as temperatures increase in the summer is consistent
with patterns reported by others for this species around the globe. Off
Japan, the general pattern of moving progressively northward as the
temperatures warm is supported by catch rates of M. mola in ﬁsh
markets along the Japanese coast (Sagara and Ozawa, 2002). This trend
has also been suggested for molas on both the east and west coast of
the United States. It is primarily in the summer months that molas are
seen at the northern extent of their range off Nova Scotia, Oregon,
Washington state and Alaska (Thys unpublished data). Similar to a
large number of other species, including whales, turtles, and blueﬁn
tuna (Mate et al., 2000; Block et al., 2001; Houghton et al., 2006a,b), it
is likely that some molas are taking advantage of the pulse of high
productivity at high latitudes while the surface waters are warm and
then returning south when temperatures cool. All molas tagged in this
study were likely immature, and thus it is unlikely that their
movements were associated with spawning. Maturity is presumably

The broad range of temperatures and depths experienced by molas
are linked to their diel vertical movement patterns, best observed in the
archival dataset. A diel pattern was also observed in the acoustic tracks
for molas off Southern California (Cartamil and Lowe, 2004), although
the dives in this study tended to be less regular with less surface
behavior than observed off Japan. The summarized data provided by
Hays et al. (2009) and Sims et al. (2009) also suggest a diel pattern. Diel
vertical movements through the mixed layer are common among a large
number of active, pelagic teleosts (Carey and Scharold, 1990; Holland
et al., 1992; Musyl et al., 2004; Weng et al., 2007; Schaefer et al., 2007).
As with most ﬁsh, the repeated dives of molas are presumed to be
associated with foraging at depth (Carey and Robison, 1981; Carey and
Scharold, 1990; Musyl et al., 2004; Schaefer et al., 2007). The
comparatively low activity levels of the mola's prey may facilitate
foraging, especially in light of the mola's unconventional form, which is
not well suited for extended pursuits (Fish and Lauder, 2006).

The similarity in the diel behavior and regular dive patterns
between molas and a number of other active pelagic ﬁsh is interesting
for numerous reasons: ﬁrst, it indicates a relatively high level of
activity for molas, which have traditionally been considered slow
moving and lethargic. The mola's ability to make 40 or more dives a
day underscores this activity level. Second, the regularity of the dives
and the reduced time at depth in cooler waters supports the
hypothesis that their surface behavior is associated with behavioral
thermoregulation. Returning to warm waters between dives has been
demonstrated to be thermoregulatory for both sharks (Carey and
Scharold, 1990; Dewar et al., 2004) and tuna (Holland et al., 1992;
Schaefer and Fuller, 2002). Cartamil and Lowe (2004) came to a similar
conclusion for molas tracked off California. As seen in bigeye tuna,
larger molas will likely spend more time at depth due to their
increased thermal inertia, which will slow the rate of cooling during
dives (Holland et al., 1992; Dagorn et al., 2000; Schaefer and Fuller,
2002). Third, the occurrences of a gradual increase and decrease in
dive depths at sunrise and sunset suggest that molas may be following
prey that is vertically migrating. Similar foraging behavior has been
widely reported for a range of vertebrates including ﬁsh, turtles, and
birds that are foraging on vertically migrating prey (Carey and
Robison, 1981; Hays, 2003; Musyl et al., 2004).

Although, diel vertical movements were consistent throughout the
record, the pattern of movements changed seasonally. The most
dramatic change was observed during the summer when dives were
much shallower and shorter. While the shift in depth could be linked
to changes in prey distribution, the reduced dive time is likely related
to thermal constraints. Due to the shallow and extreme thermocline in
the Oyashio Current in particular, very cold waters were encountered
close to the surface. Sims et al. (2009) reported a similar pattern
where the mola with the shallowest depth distributions was in waters
with the steepest thermocline. Thus, in colder regions, time at depth
and associated foraging activity appear to be reduced, a pattern also
noted for yellowﬁn tuna (Weng et al. 2009). This may represent a
trade-off while foraging in the productive waters north of the
Kuroshio Current.

Possible prey items for the molas off Japan are suggested from
transects conducted with remotely operated vehicles and towed
cameras operated by the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and
Technology. In March 2006, salps were abundant during the day in the
area off Kamogawa from 50 to 550 m with the maximum abundance
between 200 to 350 m. At night, the maximum abundance was from 0
to 80 m. Salps were also the most abundant gelatinous macroplankton
in the upper 200 m in September in a warm-core ring and in the KOTZ,
while they were not observed in the surrounding colder waters (see
Fig. 1D in Lindsay et al., 2008). A similar pattern was seen in the
physonect siphonophore, Nanomia bijuga, during April–May 2006. In
colder surrounding waters or below the thermocline, the following
species have been observed in the same depth layers where M. mola
foraging seems to predominately occur: Aglantha digitale, Bolinopsis

inﬁndibulum, Mertensia ovum, Euplokamid cydippid ctenophores,
Beroe abyssicola and the krill, Euphausia paciﬁca. Other large jellyﬁshes
known to occur in this area include Aurelia limbata (moon jelly),
Cyanea capillata (lion's mane) and Chrysaora sp. (sea nettle).

4.4. Inter-speciﬁc comparisons

Satellite tag data recorded for 61 days from a single sharp-tailed
mola in the Gulf of Mexico provides interesting comparisons (Seitz
et al., 2002) to vertical and thermal habitat use of M. mola off Japan.
The M. lanceolatus showed little of the apparent basking behavior
prevalent in M. mola and spent only 2.7% of its time in the top 5 m.
These observations are similar to reports of Taiwanese ﬁshermen who
indicate M. lanceolatus are rarely encountered on the surface and
captured primarily in set nets (Huang Brothers, Hua Lien, Taiwan,
pers. comm.). M. lanceolatus also occupied deeper waters in the Gulf of
Mexico (Seitz et al., 2002) spending approximately 25% of its time
between 10 and 50 m and nearly 50% of its time between 50 and
100 m. Despite these relatively deep depths, most of its time (86%)
was spent at temperatures above 20 °C. The coldest temperature
encountered was 6 °C. Similar to M. mola, there was an apparent diel
pattern with the deepest dives (exceeding 700 m) observed during
daylight hours. While the data suggest there may be differences in the
thermal habitats of M. mola and M.
lanceolatus, comparisons are
confounded by the differences in the water column thermal structure.
The Gulf of Mexico has considerably warmer SST and a deeper
thermocline than recorded in this study.

5. Conclusion

The data collected on the movement, behaviors, and habitats
encountered by M. mola off Japan provide important insights into their
vertical and geographic movements. These molas do not appear to
make basin-scale migrations. If movements are indeed localized, over-
exploitation off the Japanese coast may result in a loss of genetic
diversity and potentially the loss of a discrete population. However, it
should be noted that the molas in this study are juvenile ﬁsh and
mature ﬁsh may make larger-scale migrations. Molas appear to be
relatively active predators that are capable of migrating moderate
distances most likely in response to shifts in regional productivity and
temperature. From this initial baseline information, it may be possible
to use the abundance and distribution of molas as an indicator of jelly
abundance and distribution, especially for jellies that are diel
migrators and only occur on the surface at night. More tracks for a
greater size range of individuals over a longer time scale are required
to conﬁrm the overall movement patterns of molas. Additional
information on diet, possibly incorporating molecular techniques,
will also be important for deﬁning trophic links. Establishing these
links will greatly enhance the utility of the mola as an indicator species
for gelatinous zooplankton.
