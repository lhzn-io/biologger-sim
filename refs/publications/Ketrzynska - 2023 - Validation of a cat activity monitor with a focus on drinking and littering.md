ABSTRACT

Early detection of diseases and injuries  in  animals is  crucial for their health and
well-being.  Early  diagnosis  can  be  assisted  by  objective  registration  of  different
types of physical activities or behaviour patterns. Monitoring specific parameters,
such as changes in activity levels or habits, could serve as an indicator of underlying
health issues. It can be challenging for pet owners to notice subtle changes in those
characteristics at an early stage. It becomes more difficult in the case of parameters
of  a  low  frequency  of  occurrence,  such  as  drinking  and  littering  behaviours.
Hydration status is extremely important in cats and changes in drinking and littering
patterns  could  be  early  symptoms  of  potential  disorders,  in  particular  diabetes
mellitus.

There  is  a  noticeable  increase  in  owners’  awareness  about  the  physical  and
mental health of their pets. With a growing demand for higher standards of tools to
assess animals’ everyday habits, more technologies are being developed. Activity
monitors  utilizing  accelerometers  provide  broad  and  continuous  measures  of
physical activity, that enable remote and non-invasive monitoring of an individual’s
actions.

The aim of this study was to  validate the registrations of an activity monitor.
Specifically, the study aimed to assess the effectiveness of the activity monitor in
detecting drinking and littering activities, which might suggest underlying health
issues.  To  monitor  these  activities,  this  study  used  an  activity  monitor  equipped
with an accelerometer and attached to a collar. The validity and effectiveness of the
activity monitor were established by comparing the measurements obtained from
the activity collar to video recordings from the motion sensor camera.

For  forty-eight  days,  activity  data  on  drinking  and  littering  actions  were
collected  from  a  single  adult  cat.  Descriptive  statistics  were  performed  to
summarize the main findings of the dataset to obtain key results. From the total of
5989 recordings registered by the motion sensor camera, 671 recordings containing
actions of drinking and littering were selected for further analysis. Accordingly, 53
recordings  were  extracted  from  the  activity  monitor.  This  study  found  no
correlation  between  the  data  obtained  from  the  activity  monitor  and  the  video
observations  from  the  motion  sensor  camera.  Further  research  is  needed  to
investigate the reasons behind this lack of agreement and to improve methodologies
for monitoring feline activities using activity monitors.

Despite underwhelming findings, it should not rule out all potential applications
in monitoring feline behaviors, managing health disorders, and promoting overall
health remain promising.

Introduction

Early  diagnosis  of  diseases  and  injuries  in  animals  can  be  aided  by  objectively
registering  various  types  of  physical  activity  and  behavior.  Monitoring  specific
characteristics, such as changes in activity levels or alterations in habits, allows for
the detection of potential signs of illness or pain, enabling quick intervention and
care.

Diabetes  mellitus  is  a  common  endocrinopathy  in  felines  that  appears  to  be
increasing  in  prevalence  (Aspinall,  2012;  Cannon  and  Forster-Van  Hijfte,  2006;
Cooper et al., 2020). The main methods to monitor this disorder are clinical and
physical  examination,  together  with  hematology  and  biochemistry  tests,  usually
along  with  home  monitoring  of  capillary  blood  sampling  with  a  glucose  meter.
Detecting early signs of diabetes is important for quick diagnosis, intervention, and
treatment, all of which are crucial for  an animal’s overall health and well-being.
Some of the first symptoms of diabetes in cats are polydipsia (increased thirst) and
polyuria  (increased  urination)  but  pet  owners  usually  find  it  difficult  to  detect
changes in the frequency of drinking and littering (Dulaney et al., 2017).

An accelerometer is a non-invasive, wearable device that allows to track changes
based on movement and position. This approach is becoming increasingly popular
in animal science research for its capability to give broad, precise, and continuous
measures of physical activity (Karas et al. 2019; Lascelles et al., 2008, Watanabe
et al., 2005). It provides important insights into animals’ daily routines, behaviors,
and movement patterns.

This work expands on the potential of using activity collars with accelerometers
to monitor predefined activity categories commonly observed in cats with diabetes.
The specific aim of this experiment was to validate the registrations of an activity
monitor designed for cats, specifically two predefined activity categories - drinking
and litter box usage. The efficacy and precision of the monitor were compared to
video recordings of the same activities captured by the motion sensor camera. The
null hypothesis predicates absence of significant correlation between the activities
registered by the activity monitor and their corresponding videos.

1.1  Aim and research questions

The general aim of this pilot study was to validate the registrations of an activity
monitor  designed  for  cats.  Simultaneously,  the  specific  aim  was  to  assess  the
accuracy of the activity monitor in detecting drinking and litter box usage activities.
Tracking  deviations  from  established  norm  could  allow  for  early  detection  of
disorders, such as feline diabetes. The effectiveness and precision of the monitor
were compared to video recordings of the same activities.

The  objective  was  to  develop  a  non-invasive  tool  for  early  identification  and
management  of  feline  diabetes  by  comparing  the  efficacy  and  accuracy  of  the
monitor to video recordings of the same activities.

The  null  hypothesis  for  this  study  is  that  there  is  no  significant  correlation
between  the  activities  registered  by  the  activity  monitor  and  the  corresponding
videos.

The research questions are:
•  What is the potential of using activity collars with accelerometers to monitor
predefined activity categories specifically related to drinking and litter box
usage?

•  How  well  does  the  activity  recorded  by  the  activity  monitor  match  the

activity observed from video recordings? What is the correlation?

2.  Literature review

2.1  Cat activity monitoring

2.1.1  Accelerometer

An accelerometer enables tracking changes based on movement and orientation -
if something is changing directions, how quickly it is moving up or slowing down,
the intensity and frequency of its movements, and other related parameters (Kooros,
2021). It measures acceleration, which is the rate at which velocity changes with
time, both in terms of speed and direction.

The common structure of an accelerometer involves a small proof mass attached
to a device that allows it to react correspondingly to changes in acceleration. The
displacement of the proof mass is measured by sensors such as piezoelectric crystals
or capacitors and after that expressed in gravitational units relative to the device's
standpoint (Karas et al., 2019). Accelerometer data is processed using a variety of
algorithms into summaries that can be combined at different temporal levels (e.g.,
minutes,  hours,  or  days)  and  can  have  a  variety  of  tags  (e.g.,  steps,  calories,
exercise, etc., in animal research e.g., activity, play, grooming, etc.) (Karas et al.,
2019). There are different types of those devices but the  most used is the 3-axis
accelerometer  which  has
three
perpendicular axes, typically labelled as x, y, and z (Chapa et al., 2020). This makes
it  possible  to  determine  the  dynamic  body’s  acceleration.  As  monitors  have
advanced, they are now frequently fitted with a variety of supplemental  sensors,
such as a gyroscope used to detect deviation of an object from its desired direction.
Other  additional  sensors  like  magnetometers  and  barometers  can  provide
supplementary  information  about  orientation,  and  environmental  conditions,
enabling a broader understanding of animal’s activity.

three  acceleration  sensors  positioned

in

Accelerometers  are  used  in  mobile  devices  to  detect  orientation,  in  cars  to
measure  speed,  in  sport  and  fitness  to  measure  movement,  to  detect  mechanical
issues  in  industrial  equipment,  or  in  aerospace  to  monitor  the  performance  of
aircraft and such. In human medicine, accelerometers are used for research on i.e.,
the  impact  of  age  on  physical  activity  (Wolff-Hughes  et  al.,  2018)  or  functional
recovery after surgery (Cook et al., 2013). In animal science, there is a significant
increase in published studies using accelerometers in research. Further analysis on
this topic will be presented in subsequent sections of this work.

Activity collars, which use the accelerometer technique, enable tracking changes
based on movement and orientation. The accelerometer technology embedded in
activity collars provides a means to monitor and analyse the dynamic behavior of
animals, allowing for a deeper understanding of their activities and behaviors.

Wearable  accelerometers  offer  thorough,  accurate,  and  ongoing  measures  of
physical activity in humans (Karas et al., 2019) and animals (Hansen et al., 2007;
Jones et al., 2014; Lascelles et al., 2008, Ringgenberg et al., 2010; Robert et al.,
2009’  Yamazaki  et  al.,  2020).  That  allows  researchers  to  identify  and  compare
critical periods of movement, which provides insights into the physical activity of
an  individual.  Accelerometers  are  frequently integrated  into  portable  devices
because  they  are  physically  small  and  lightweight  (Zhou  and  Hu,  2008)  which
improves the comfort and practicality of long-term monitoring for animals. Such
monitors are usually worn on an animal’s limb, as an ear tag, or as a collar attached
around the neck. There is a recommendation that monitoring devices should not
weigh  more than 5% of  the body mass of an  animal  (Coughlin and van  Heezik,
2014; Dickinson et al., 2020). However, instruments weighing less than 3% BM,
according  to  simulation,  may  nonetheless  influence  the  movement  patterns  of
individuals.  Coughlin  and  van  Heezik  (2014)  demonstrated that  domestic  cats
wearing heavier collars (>3% BM) reduced their activity compared to when they
wore lighter collars. This study modified the suggestion on the weight of monitors
to below 2% body mass.

There is a current increase in awareness among pet owners about the importance
of monitoring their animals' physical activity. This led to a rise in a variety of gears
introduced  to  the  market  that  allows  to  increase  the  well-being  of  companion
animals. Pet owners are recognizing the benefits of using activity collars as a tool
to understand their pet's daily behavior patterns, activity levels, and health status
since these are convenient and non-invasive tools to track and monitor animals’.

With developing technology such devices are becoming more advanced. Some
models can monitor parameters like heart rate, respiratory details,  sleep patterns,
temperature, and calories burned.  The integration of advanced technologies, like
machine learning and artificial intelligence, further enhances the analysis of animal
activity. These technologies enable automated data processing, pattern recognition,
and the extraction of meaningful details from data.

Cats have unique activity patterns and behaviors compared to other animals, and
activity collars should be designed specifically to monitor and track these feline-
specific activities. This includes behaviors such as grooming, scratching, climbing,
and littering. It  might  be especially  challenging  considering their tendency to  be
more active during nighttime and their outdoor behaviors. In these cases, activity
monitors could be advantageous tools.

2.1.2  Studies on reliability and validation of activity monitors in

cats

In recent years, there has been a significant increase in published studies utilizing
accelerometers in animal science research. These devices have gained popularity
due  to  their  low  cost,  non-invasiveness,  and  ability  to  provide  quantitative

10

measurements  of  activity.  Various  studies  have  applied  accelerometers  to  study
different animal species and behaviors. Brown et al. (2013) use accelerometers to
observe free-ranging wildlife, while Barwick et al. (2018a, 2018b, 2020) focused
on  measuring  posture  and  activity  states  in  sheep.  In  Robert  et  al.  (2009),  the
classification  of  lying  and  standing  activities  using  accelerometers  in  cattle
demonstrated  excellent  correlation  with  video  observations,  with  a  99.2%
correlation for lying and a 98.0% for standing. Similarly, Ringgenberg et al. (2010)
achieved accurate identification of different postures in sows using accelerometers,
with values correctly identified above 90% for all postures. In a study by Barwick
et al. (2018b), the effectiveness of different accelerometer placements (ear, neck,
and leg) in differentiating locomotion in sheep was investigated, revealing that the
ear placement demonstrated high accuracy in predicting grazing (94%), standing
(96%),  and  walking  (99%)  events,  making  it  the  most  suitable  placement  for
identifying basic sheep behaviors.

Additionally,  accelerometers  were  used  in  dogs  to  monitor  disorders  that
decrease  mobility  (like  osteoporosis  or  OA),  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  pain
management after receiving NSAIDs medication treatment (Lascelles et al., 2007;
Lascelles et al., 2008, Andrews et al., 2015), and to compare postoperative activity
of dogs undergoing laparoscopic and open ovariectomy (Culp et al., 2009).

Chapa et al. (2020) conducted a study to explore the use of accelerometers for
welfare  and  health  evaluation  in  cattle  and  pigs  based  on  the  Welfare  Quality®
assessment guidelines. The study demonstrated that  accelerometers showed high
accuracy  in  most  parameters  for  movement  and  resting  behaviors,  which  could
serve  as  indicators  of  compromised  welfare  and  health.  By  tracking  these
parameters, accelerometers could be used as an early warning system to identify
specific factors that pose risks to an individual's well-being.

Another  notable  study  by  Jones  et  al.  (2014)  investigated  the  use  of
accelerometers as a tool to secure animal welfare in a group of shelter dogs. The
study aimed to determine if activity levels measured by accelerometers could serve
as an indicator of physiological and behavioral stress. The findings highlighted the
potential of accelerometer data in monitoring and controlling stress levels in shelter
dogs, thereby reducing behavioral issues, and improving the chances of a successful
adoption.

Watanabe et al. (2005) conducted one of the earliest research into the potential
of using accelerometer devices in cats. The study aimed to characterize different
behaviors  efficiently  using  an  activity  monitor.  While  the  study  recorded  high
accuracy  for  behaviors  such  as  drinking  (100%)  and  eating  (68.4%),  data  on
elimination was not captured, which is one of interest in this project.

Lascelles  et  al.  (2008)  evaluated  the  relationship  between  cat  movement
recorded on video and information from an accelerometer-based activity monitor.
The study found a high correlation (adjusted R2 0.95) between the data collected

11

from  the  harness  and  collar  accelerometers  from  3  cats.  However,  the  harness
initially caused a decrease in mobility, likely due to discomfort. The experiment
compared  432  hours  of  activity  data  from  computer-analyzed  footage  and
simultaneously acquired accelerometer data. Overall, there was a 0.82 correlation
(adjusted R2) between accelerometer data and distance travelled. Researchers also
aimed to evaluate the daily and weekly changes in activity, as a tool to monitor pain
relief in disorders that decrease mobility.

Andrews et al., (2015) aimed to quantify the degree of inter-individual variance
by validating accelerometers in 13 cats. Currently, this study has the biggest number
of experimental units in research on cat activity using accelerometers.  The study
concluded that accelerometers could be used to precisely and remotely measure the
time  spent  active  in  domestic  cats.  It  also  emphasized  the  significance  of
considering  inter-cat  variation  and  using  individuals  as  their  own  control  when
evaluating changes in activity levels.

Activity  monitors  are  attracting  attention  for  the  early  detection  of  different
disorders and monitoring animal welfare. While present project specifically focuses
on the use of an accelerometer to monitor key activities for diabetic cats (drinking
and litter box usage), similar approaches have been explored in the context of other
disorders.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common disorder in older cats, causing chronic pain and
reduced mobility (Stadig et al., 2016). Currently, there is no validated systems for
measuring  pain  in  cats  with  OA  (Lascelles  et  al.,  2007).  Researchers  have
investigated various tools to assist in pain assessment. For example, Brown et al.
(2010) explored the use of activity monitors to detect changes in activity levels in
dogs with OA treated with carprofen or a placebo. Lascelles et al. (2007) found that
owners' subjective assessments  combined with  the use of activity monitors were
valuable  in  identifying  pain-related  behaviors  and  assessing  the  response  to
NSAID treatment  in  cats  with  OA  at  home.  The  objective  data  obtained  from
accelerometer-based  activity  monitors  hold  the  potential  to  verify  subjective
assessment methods and enhance the clinical evaluation of chronic pain in cats.

Additionally,  studies  have  examined  the  use  of  accelerometers  to  detect

oestrus-related locomotor frequency changes in cats (Andrews et al., 2022).

Overall, these studies highlighted growing interest and potential of applications
of accelerometers in animal science research, which provides valuable insights into
activity monitoring, welfare assessment, and the detection of various diseases.

There have been studies at Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU)
conducted to validate cat activity monitor with predefined categories of activities.
Two  bachelor  theses  and  one  master’s  thesis  investigated  registrations  from  cat
activity collars and their correlation with activity observed through video analysis
(Devlin  and  Olausson,  2018;  Arvidsson  and  Spence,  2018;  Mathiasson,  2019).
While those student theses utilized similar tool, the specific objectives and details

12

of  those  studies  differ  from  the  current  research.  Notably,  neither  drinking  nor
elimination behaviors were examined independently in any of mentioned projects.
In  their  pilot  studies,  Devlin  and  Olausson  (2018),  as  well  as  Arvidsson  and
Spence (2018), aimed to evaluate whether an accelerometer-based activity monitor
can  effectively  quantify  and  categorize  feline  activity.  Arvidsson  and  Spence
(2018) recorded two cats, Katt 1 for approximately 78 minutes, and Katt 2 for 108
minutes.  The  study  combined  eating  and  drinking  as  one  category  for  video
analysis, with Katt 1 spending 7% of recorded time on eating and drinking, and Katt
2 for 11,5%. However, there were no records regarding drinking only. No data were
registered for elimination activities, neither by the activity monitor nor the camera.
In  Devlin  and  Olausson's  (2018)  study,  used  activity  monitors  were  unable  to
register elimination or drinking activities in cats, and as a result, no data regarding
these  behaviors  were  captured.  By  the  inclusion  of  these  categories  in  the  study
authors proposed important topic and area for future research.

In Mathiasson's (2019) study, a total of five hours and 40 minutes of recordings
of  six  cats  were  collected.  The  activity  monitor  used  in  the  study  registered
elimination and drinking activities in some cats. However, it is important to note
that there were no corresponding video records of these activities to confirm the
occurrence, that is why those entries were fully excluded from the analysis.

A  common  conclusion  was  recognition  of  a  great  potential  of  using
accelerometers  in  evaluating  patients  and  treatments.  These  theses  collectively
contributed  to  the  understanding  of  the  potential  of  using  accelerometers  in
assessing cat activity and provided insights into the limitations and possibilities for
future studies in this field.

Having examined the existing literature on activity collars in cats, it is crucial to
assess  the  reliability  of  these  devices  through  dedicated  validation  studies.
Validation is necessary to assure precise measurements, allow for comparison, and
increase confidence regarding the results of studies. It provides a base for accurate
results, improving research and expanding  knowledge of feline behavior,  health,
and  wellbeing.  Comparing  accelerometer  data  with  direct  observation  of  the
animal's behavior can help validate the measurements.

An increased of number owner-friendly and commercialized accelerometers are
available  on  the  market,  such  as  PetPace  (<https://petpace.com/>),  Whistle
(<https://www.whistle.com/>),  and  Moggie  designed  especially  for  cats  camer.
Currently, the best validated device used in research on physical activity of animals
is Actical®, that is already widely used in human activity monitoring (Belda et al.,
2018). The goal of Belda et al. (2018) study was to determine whether the activity
output from Actical® and Actigraph, validated in dogs, matched the activity output
from  commercially  available  the  PetPace  device  and  observed  a  moderate
correlation  of  0.59.  Yamazaki  et  al.  (2020)  used  Plus  Cycle®,  a  new  monitor
designed for cats, and compared it to Actical®, Results shown correlation of a 0.89

13

total activity and 0.78 activity intensity for Plus Cycle®, and a strong correlation
of 0.89 with Actical®.

The  growing  interest  in  assessing  everyday  habits  of  companion  animal  has
increased the need to acquire objective assessments of activity at home. This was
demonstrated in a study by Hansen et al. (2007), where the relationship between
movement  and  motion  captured  on  film  and  accelerometer-measured  activity  in
healthy dogs was determined, highlighting  the value of accelerometers as useful
devices for objective, ongoing physical activity monitoring in an everyday context.
The  study  showed  excellent  estimates  of  activity  with  Spearman  correlations
ranging from 0.71 to 0.93 for all comparisons with movement distance and duration
when  accelerometers  were  placed  on  eight  different  locations  on  the  body.  This
enables a better understanding of an individual's movement patterns, behavior, and
general health in an everyday context.

2.2  Feline diabetes

Diabetes mellitus is an endocrinopathy caused by a complete or partial shortage of
the hormone insulin, which is crucial for controlling blood glucose levels (Aspinall,
2012; Cannon and Forster-Van Hijfte, 2006; Cooper et al., 2020). It is characterized
by hyperglycaemia (high levels of blood sugar).

Depending  on  the  literature,  diabetes  mellitus  is  usually  divided  into  four
different types, but the most common ones are types 1 and 2.  In type 1 diabetes the
body  is  not  producing  insulin  which  is  causing  the  glucose  blood  level  to  rise
(American  Diabetes  Association,  2013).  The  body’s  immune  cells  strike  the
pancreas,  specifically  beta  cells  in  the  islet  of  Langerhans  responsible  for  the
secretion of insulin  (Cooper et  al.,  2020).  It is  rarely  observed in  cats,  but  more
often in middle-aged dogs. Type 2 diabetes is non-insulin dependent, meaning that
the  body  makes  insulin  but  doesn’t  respond  to  it  correctly  (American  Diabetes
Association, 2013). Due to high amounts of blood sugar, insulin is maintaining the
stability of those levels, resolving in reduced activity of beta cells and decreased
secretion of insulin. Diabetes type 2 is more common in cats compared to dogs.

Environmental risk factors for cats include advancing age (usually five years old
and  more),  male  gender,  obesity,  neutering,  pharmaceutical  treatment,  lack  of
physical activity, and indoor confinement (Rand et al., 2004).

In cats, there are three early symptoms of diabetes:
•  polyuria (PU) - increased urination,
•  polydipsia (PI) - increased thirst,
•  weight loss (Aspinall, 2012; Cannon and Forster-Van Hijfte, 2006; Cooper

et al., 2020).

14

Other  observed  signs  include  lethargy,  changes  in  behaviour,  polyphagia
(increased hunger), and glycosuria (presence of glucose in the urine) (Cooper et al.,
2020).  It  is  important  to  remember  that  those  signs  could  be  symptoms of  other
diseases in cats.

therapy,  antidiabetic  medications,  and
involves
Recommendations  include  a  healthy  diet,  regulation  of  food  intake,  weight  loss,
exercise, and pharmaceutical care (Cannon and Forster-Van Hijfte, 2006; Cooper
et  al.,  2020).  For  diabetes to  be  managed  effectively,  lifelong dedication  and
compliance are necessary.

As a result of urbanization and domestication cats have changed from hunting
animals  that  consumed  protein-rich  prey  to  more  sedentary  animals  that  ingest
commercially  produced  diet  high  in  carbohydrates  (Slingerland  et  al.,  2009).
Consequently,  the  pancreas  cannot  secrete  such  high  amounts  of  insulin  to
continuously lower blood sugar levels. Change of diet is a very important part of
maintaining feline diabetes and it is recommended to feed it a naturally high protein
low sugar diet.

2.2.1  Drinking and urination habits in cats

Cats naturally have a relatively low desire to drink, thus they are slow to react when
their level of hydration changes (Buckley et al., 2011). The amount of water a cat
should drink in a day may vary based on factors like age, diet, weight, and activity
levels. However, there is no consensus on a definition of adequate water intake or
optimal hydration in cats (Zanghi, 2017).

One of the objectives of Robbins et al. (2018) study was to determine if vessel
that the water was, and its general presentation, influenced daily fluid consumption.
The  average  water  intake  came  up  to  27.483  ml/kg/day  for  still  water,  26.327
ml/kg/day for circulating, and 26.137 ml/kg/day for free-falling. It was concluded
that  water  bowl  type  had  no  significant  effect  on  water  intake.  Depending  on
circumstances, these values could be considered representative of the average water
intake in cats.

Further, the diet greatly effects daily water consumption (Bradshaw et al., 2013).
Dietary moisture has a major influence on the amount of water consumed daily and
directly affects the percentage of water consumed by drinking (Zanghi, 2017). Cats
on  a  wet  food  diet  obtain  a  substantial  amount  of  moisture  through  their  food,
resulting  in  lower water  intake from  drinking (Zanghi, 2017;  2018). Wet  or raw
diets, which typically contain over 75% moisture, tend to reduce the cat's reliance
on drinking water (Buckley et al., 2011). The findings of Zanghi et al. (2018) study
showed that consumption of nutrient-enriched water from wet food increased the
amount  of  water  consumed  through  drinking  which  is  strongly  associated  with
changes in the total water intake and diluted urine.

15

On the other hand, cats fed dry food consume less moisture from their diet and
compensate by drinking more water (Zanghi, 2017; 2018). However, it's important
to  note  that  even  though  cats  on  a  dry  food  diet  may  increase  their  voluntary
drinking  by  nearly  six  times,  they  still  consume  approximately  30%  less  water
overall compared to cats on a wet food diet (Buckley et al., 2011).

Generally, fresh water should always be accessible for an individual to drink. To

encourage drinking additional measures could be applied:

increased number of drinking bowls,

•
•  adjusted characteristics of the bowl itself, such as material (ceramic/glass),

width, depth,
frequent refilling with fresh water,

•
•  adequate distance between bowl and litter box,
•  added flavouring, such as tuna, chicken broth (all unsalted),
•  adjusting dietary sodium content to stimulate drinking (Zanghi, 2018).
Setting  a  daily  voluntary  water  consumption  goal  for  diabetic  cats  is  not
achievable (Sparkes et al., 2015). To monitor the daily water intake in diabetic cats,
the simplest method is to use a measuring cup and compare the water weight at the
beginning of the day with that after 24 hours, as suggested by Mitchell (2023) and
Robbins et al. (2018). Another tool useful to monitor water intake would be a smart
fountain or water bowl. These devices can weigh the remaining liquid, enabling the
monitoring of a cat's daily hydration levels. Any deviations from the recommended
water intake should be simple to trace. However, it is important to note that this
weighing may not be applicable for outdoor cats, as their access to multiple water
sources  and  potential  water  consumption  outside  monitored  area  could  lead  to
inaccurate measurements.

In  cats  with  diabetes,  the  presence  of  insulin  resistance  or  inadequate  insulin
synthesis prevents the body from correctly using glucose. Consequently, glucose
that remained in the bloodstream causes hyperglycemia and osmotic imbalances.
To counteract this, water is drawn from cells and tissues into circulation, resulting
in an increased need to drink more (Cornell Feline Health Center, 2018).

When the endocrine system fails to effectively maintain blood sugar balance, the
kidneys take on the main role of reducing glucose levels by increasing urination
and eliminating excess glucose from the bloodstream through the process known as
glucosuria (Reusch, 2015). Diabetic cats frequently experience increased thirst due
to dehydration and will drink  more water to  replenish fluid loss. However, even
with  increased  fluid  intake,  diabetic  cats  may  still  face  dehydration  due  to  the
excessive  loss  of  fluids  during  urination,  which  often  occurs  because  of  diluted
urine. It can appear as a common pattern of polyuria, dehydration, and polydipsia.
Several common comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease, induce a steady
loss of body fluid, and monitoring of hydration status of the cat, especially senior,
is crucial (Ray et al., 2021).

16

Cats with polydipsia may also potentially show signs of inappropriate urination
because  access  to  toileting  sites  becomes  limiting  with  the  increased  need  to
eliminate (Bradshaw, 2012).

It is crucial to pay attention to both drinking and elimination patterns in cats with
diabetes.  Monitoring  urination  is  challenging  but  observing  the  litter  box  can
provide valuable information, such as the frequency of elimination, and the size and
colour of litter lumps. Some litter boxes have built in scales, which could allow to
measure urine output.

Characteristics of a satisfactory littering area for a cat include a suitable number
of litter boxes filled with  custom substrate. The  area should be away from  feed,
quiet and hidden, and without potential threats (Bradshaw, 2012). However, it is
important  to  mention  that  these  characteristics  apply  mostly  to  indoor  cats,  as
outdoor  cats  may  have  different  preferences  and  behaviors  regarding  littering
habits.

2.3  Monitoring of feline diabetes

Initial diagnosis of diabetes in cats consists of clinical and physical examination,
together  with  haematology  and  biochemistry  tests  (Aspinall,  2012;  Cannon  and
Forster-Van  Hijfte,  2006;  Cooper  et  al.,  2020).  In  ISFM  Consensus  Guidelines,
Sparkes et al. (2015) explained the timeline of diagnosis of feline diabetes. It starts
with an evaluation of the blood glucose curve (BGC) measured over the span of 12
hours (Reusch et al., 2006). During that period, blood samples are taken every 2
hours to detect elevated blood glucose levels. Initial BGC is required to detect the
nadir and degree of blood glucose fluctuation. Additionally, serum fructosamine
levels  are  often  assessed  alongside  the  BGC,  providing  a  broader  overview  of
average  glucose  regulation  over  the  previous  weeks,  without  influence  of  short-
term  stress  hyperglycemia  (Sparkes  et  al.,  2015).  Additional  tests  could  be
conducted,  such  as  urinalysis  to  detect  the  presence  of  glucose  in  the  urine
(glucosuria).  Regular  blood  panel  testing  may  be  also  necessary  to  establish
baseline  results  and  determine  the  appropriate  insulin  dosage  for  cats  diagnosed
with diabetes (Cooper et al., 2020). The results of these tests are discussed with a
veterinarian,  and  an  individualized  plan  for  further  treatment,  management,  and
follow-up visits is established.

Regular monitoring is essential for effective management of diabetes in cats. It
relies on regular evaluations and owner’s awareness of clinical signs (Reusch et al.,
2006). This includes daily observations of behaviour, water and food intake, urine
output,  and  weekly  measurements  of  weight  and  body  condition.  When  a  cat  is
considered  stable,  BGS  should  be  repeated  every  3  to  4  weeks,  and  it  is
recommended to run a full blood panel test every 3 to 6 months to assess general

17

health and organ function (Sparkes et al., 2015). The frequency of testing may vary
depending on the individual cat's condition and recommendations of veterinarian.
Due to characteristics of most cats, hospitalization and repetitive blood sampling
(however gentle) may cause the concentration of blood glucose to be significantly
influenced  by  stress  or  refusal  to  eat  (Casella  et  al.,  2003;  Reusch  et  al.,  2006).
Therefore, data produced from in-clinic BGC may not be entirely accurate resulting
in incorrect judgment of the cat’s condition, it is important to consider these aspects
when interpreting blood glucose results.

Frequent  visits  to  veterinary  clinics  for  managing  chronic  disorders  can  be
challenging, particularly for cats that are known for being demanding patients. To
minimize stress and protect their welfare during veterinary visits, collective efforts
are  made.  In  order  to  elevate  health  and  quality  of  life  of  companion  animals,
veterinary  researchers  are  incorporating  combination  of  standard  in-office
evaluations  with  assessments  at  home  (Hansen  et  al.,  2007),  resulting  in  more
comprehensive  understanding  of  an  individual.  This  approach  is  particularly
valuable since the duration of time spent at home is typically longer than that spent
in a veterinary clinic (Lascelles et al., 2008).

In  human  medicine,  self-monitoring  of  diabetes  is  commonly  done  using
portable  glucose  meters.  Similar  technology  has  been  introduced  in  veterinary
science (e.g., AlphaTRAK) and is used to manage diabetes in companion animals
with equipment validated for specific species. Glucose meters  are simple to use,
require  a  little  sample  volume,  deliver  results  quickly,  and  are  less  distressing.
Because  cats  are  prone  to  stress  hyperglycaemia,  glucose  meters  have  been
recognized  as  a  more  effective  and  safer  approach  for  assessing  glycemic
conditions (Cannon and Forster-Van Hijfte, 2006; Sparkes et al., 2015). Therefore,
it can facilitate management of feline diabetes and improve the monitoring of blood
glucose levels in cats (Kang et al., 2015). Capillary blood sampling is done using
blood from capillary or marginal ear veins (Sparkes et al., 2015). Capillary blood
glucose  check  is  recommended  twice  a  week  or  when  concerned  about  the
wellbeing of the cat (Reusch et al., 2001; Reusch, 2015; Sparkes et al., 2015).

2.3.1  Activity monitors in feline diabetes

Currently, there are no studies that used activity monitor after diagnosis of feline
diabetes or during the treatment.

Accelerometers can contribute to diagnosis and management of diabetes in cats
mostly by allowing to monitor activity levels overall. Regular physical activity can
help  with  weight  control,  tone  of  muscles,  better  insulin  sensitivity,  while
simultaneously aid in the regulation of blood sugar levels (Slingerland et al., 2009).
By monitoring cat’s activity patterns, owner could assure that individual is getting
enough exercise, which overall helps to control diabetes better. Additionally, data
from accelerometers can be used as a basis for behavior or activity patterns of an

18

individual.  Any  deviations  or  changes  from  the  recognized  norm  could  signal
changes  in  blood  sugar levels  or possible risks to health because cats  with  well-
managed diabetes should behave and engage in normal levels of activity (Cornell
Feline Health Center, 2018).

Secondly, some monitors can categorize and track activities important to control

in diabetic cats such as frequency of visits to the water bowl and litter box.

While the use of accelerometers to monitor drinking behavior in cats currently
lacks  research,  exploring  the  application  of  this  technology  in  other  species  can
provide valuable insights and inspire future studies. For instance, a pilot experiment
conducted by Williams et al. (2019) investigated the feasibility of using head-neck
position and activity to detect and record drinking behavior in beef cattle. The study
demonstrated  that  neck-mounted  triaxial  accelerometers  accurately  classified
drinking  behavior  from  standing  (head  up)  with  100%  accuracy.  These  findings
highlight the potential of accelerometers to increase awareness of drinking habits
and ensure that their water consumption needs are met.

Comparing accelerometer data before and after a specific treatment can provide
information  on  the  effectiveness  of  management  of  individual  to  owner  and
veterinarian.

3.  Materials and methods

3.1  Literature search and roles in experiment

The term “observer” used in this study refers to the researcher and author of this
text. As the primary investigator and data collector, the Observer played an active
role in observing and analysing performed activities.

To study background information a lot of effort  was put into finding relevant
publications.  The  main  search  engines  used  for  finding  scientific  literature  were
Web of Science, Google Scholar, and PubMed. Rest of materials was found in three
veterinary textbooks in university library.

Search  keywords  included:  accelerometer*,  activity,  "activity  monitor",  cat*,
feline*. Literature search using keywords was challenging due to limited research
on using activity monitors in cats and almost none in validating this device as  a
diagnostic tool in feline health.

Total  reference  list  came  up  to  47
regarding  different  aspects
positions
included  in  this  study.  Three  studies  on
validation  of  activity  monitors  in  cats
were given the  most  attention  (Andrews
et  al.,  2015;  Lascelles  et  al.,  2008;
Watanabe et al., 2005).

Some  information  was  added  after
email  correspondence  with  activity
monitor provider.

3.2  Materials

According to Swedish legislation, ethical
approval was not required for this type of
study.  Animal  guardian  consent  was
signed and stored.

The  study  was  conducted  in  a  cat
shelter.  The  experiment  covered  one
individual,  called  further  “experimental  unit”.  The  cat  was  a  castrated,  domestic
shorthair  male  that  weighed  5.5  kilograms.  Its  age  was  assumed  to  be  around  3
years, but little was known about its history because he was found as a stray kitten.
The individual had eye problem that required medication but other than that he was

clinically sound before and during the experiment. Its health conditions were not a
contraindication to the use of the selected methods.

3.3  Husbandry and feeding

The experimental unit shared the space with 2 to 4 cats. This number fluctuated due
to  adoptions,  veterinary  treatment,  and  shelter  management.  Dynamic  between
individuals was not intense, there was no conflicts or hierarchy fights observed or
known by staff.

The size of the shelter room was 2,30 x 1,90 meters. In it there were feeding and

drinking bowls, litter boxes, cat tree, and enrichment such as shelves and toys.

Cats were fed three times a day. On May 17th, 2023, the feed plan was changed
from 3 to 2 portions a day, which resulted in altered water intake (discussed later).
The  kibble  itself  was  also  changed  from  Mjau  to  Royal  Canine,  specifically  to
Savour Exigent.

Cats  were  always  provided  at  least  2  bowls  of  water.  Water  was  additionally
changed  twice  per  day  to  keep  it  fresh.  Litter  boxes  were  cleaned  frequently.
Additionally, boxes and litter were changed completely once a week.

This experiment was observational, and no direct interventions were added other

than paying closer attention to water bowls.

3.4  Pilot study

Activity monitor
For this study  collar manufacturer company kindly  lent out  one activity monitor
developed specially to measure cats’ activity.

This activity monitor is marketed as an option for pet owners to get an insight
into animal’s daily pattern. It guarantees to collect data immediately, 24 hours a day
and send it to owner’s phone into compatible app (Moggie.me, 2023).

21

Monitor was equipped with the 3-
axis accelerometer and gyroscope. Its
sensors  take  150  measurements  of
movement  per  second.  For  these
devices  to  be  commercially  capable,
data must be collected, processed, and
analysed  simultaneously  with  data
gathering  (Barwick  et  al.,  2020).  It
weighed 8 grams, which is according
to  Coughlin  and  van  Heezik  (2014)
suggestions.

Figure 2. Activity monitor

The battery of this device is expected to

last 3 to 4 weeks and can be charged with USB-C cable.

For  safety  measures  and  to  avoid  getting  it  wet,  monitor  was  taped  around.
Equipment was charged fully, attached to a standard pet collar, and placed ventrally
on the individual.

The activity monitor was connected via Bluetooth to wireless base. The base was

transmitting data to a data server through stable internet connection.

As the animal moved or engaged in various activities, the triaxial accelerometer
recorded shifts in acceleration. Algorithms were integrated into the activity monitor
software to analyse the raw data gathered from the accelerometer. Obtained values
were  compared  with  pre-programmed  activity  categories,  allowing  software  to
assign  the  most  appropriate  activity  category  based  on  measured  acceleration
patterns.

Predefined activity categories of monitor are sleep, walk, play, eat, groom, jump,

rest, drink, and litter. This project focuses on the last two.

Camera
This  study  strongly  relied  on  on-going  video  recording.  Because  the  room  was
supposed to be recorded 24/7, to decrease time spend on video footage analysis,
decision was made to use motion sensor camera which simplified the process of
detection of desired events.

22

The  decided  model  was  called  AXIS  M3086-V  Dome  Network  Camera
manufactured by Axis Communications AB. This product was marketed to provide
great quality image in difficult light conditions (<www.axis.com>, n.d.).

Few important technical aspects of this camera were:
•  Wide Dynamic Range (WDR) – technology that improves image quality in

challenging light conditions, both bright and dim,

•  2.4mm lens – allows to capture a broader scene,
•  F2.1 aperture – allows more light to enter the camera,
•  Shutter speed 1/38500 s to 1/5 s – provides flexibility to adapt to various

light conditions,

•  25/30 fps – common frame rate used in video recordings providing standard

viewing.

The  motion  camera  model  features  a  deep  learning  processing  unit  (DLPU),
which  enables  intelligent  analytics  for  fast,  efficient  searches  in  both  live  and
recorded videos. Moreover, with the preinstalled AXIS Object Analytics software,
it is feasible to analyse video streams to detect and track specific objects or events
of interest. This combination of advanced hardware and software ensures quick and
accurate analysis of video data for a variety of purposes.

was 1.58 GB indicating a grand amount of data collected for this study.

Video analysis
The purpose of the video analysis was to determine whether the activity monitor’s
readings  align  with  the  activities  captured  in  the  videos  in  order  to  evaluate
monitor's effectiveness and accuracy.

Approximately  once  a  week  camera  was  accessed  by  connecting  it  to  a  Dell
Vostro 5502 laptop using an Ethernet cable. Network protocol  IPv4 was used to
locate camera’s IP address and establish connection between camera and the laptop.
In AXIS portal all video recordings were listed. First stage of analysis included
exclusion of videos that featured other cats in the room and not experimental unit,
as well as videos completely unrelated to drinking, eating, and littering. Remaining
videos were uploaded and saved in folders with the corresponding dates. Data on
start, end, and duration of activities  were entered manually to  Microsoft® Excel
document once a week.

Analysis of the video material was conducted before the access to raw data from

activity monitor.

Protocol
The equipment setup for the experiment took place on April 18th, 2023, marking it
the  beginning  of  the  study.  The  activity  monitor  base  was  provisioned  through
Wi-Fi to be activated. Monitor was securely attached to available collar and put on
the cat. On the same day the motion sensor camera was set up and area of interest
was designed. The camera operated continuously, recording 24 hours a day, 7 days
a week, for a duration of 48 days.  Experiment was concluded on June 5th, 2023,
with disassembly of all the equipment involved in the study.

To ensure collection of all triggered videos a well-planned data collection was
essential,  that  is  why  weekly  visits  to  the  cat  shelter  (site  of  experiment)  were
conducted in a weekly basis throughout the duration of this project. In total, 8 visits
were made with the purpose of data gathering. The memory card in the camera had
maximum capacity of thirty days’ worth of storage. Any videos recorded beyond
this  period  were  overlapping  of  the  videos  captured  at  the  beginning  of  the
experiment.

Additionally, activity monitor was supposed to have enough battery life to run

for 3 weeks. To avoid any setbacks, it was charged fully three times.

Until the 8th  of May, which marked the twentieth day of the experiment, the
video  analysis  primarily  focused  on  two  activities:  urination  and  drinking.
However, the analysis was quickly expanded to include elimination, as the activity
monitor is,  undoubtedly, unable to differentiate  between actions during littering.
Additionally,  eating  was  included  as  an  observed  activity  due  to  relatively  low
number  of  registrations  for  drinking  alone  as  well  as  potential  similarities  in
repetitive motions or movement patterns. Data analysis focused on data between 8th
of May and 4th of June. Entries before 8th served as additional results or information.

24

The protocols were kept by observer, that is reviews of both video footage and
raw data from the activity monitor throughout the entire duration of the experiment.
Data were weekly entered manually to Microsoft® Excel document and recordings
stored.

Data analysis
On  three  separate  occasions  the  collar  fell  off  from  the  cat.  Those  data  were
excluded  from  analysis  due  to  error  sources,  as  well  as  times  during  which  the
monitor was being charged. Entries for which the files were lost, were also excluded
from analysis.

Since study took place in a cat shelter, apart from experimental unit other cats
were  present  in  the  room.  This  made  video  analysis  troublesome  during  eating,
because during feeding,  four to  eight bowls were available for the group. It  was
established that if there were more than three seconds between eating, those entries
would  be  kept  as  separate  activities.  It  often  took  the  individual  less  than  three
seconds to shift head to other bowl. If that contained more movement, like walking
to other bowl, then since it is a different activity, it was kept separate.

Respective  data  were  extracted  from  activity  monitor  and  assembled  with

interpretation of cat’s actions throughout experiment period as .json files1.

Data  from  activity  monitor  that  were  representing  time  were  timestamped  in
EPOCH seconds and needed conversation to human time. Before any analysis time
synchronization of data was performed from UTC to CET time.

Microsoft Excel® files for both video analysis and data from activity monitor
were stored by observer. Charts and tables based on the data were created in the
same  program.  The  character  of  the  data  set  allowed  for  the  application  of
descriptive statistics alone. No statistical analyses or modeling were conducted due
lack of sufficient data. The descriptive statistics served to provide a comprehensive
overview of the key findings and summarize results in a clear manner without the
need for complex analysis.

4.  Results

At the end of the study, 5989 recordings were registered by motion sensor camera.
Total duration of the video recordings with  activities of interest  amounted to  18
hours, 40 minutes, and 16 seconds. From those recordings, specific activities were
timestamped and analysed, resulting in a summary of 10 hours, 13 minutes, and 52
seconds.

A compilation of all registrations for observed and registered activities during
the study period was made in Table 3. Length of video data approved to analysis
was 9 hours 48 minutes and 50 seconds with:
•  30 minutes and 39 seconds of littering,
•  1 hour 15 minutes and 7 seconds of drinking,
•  8 hours, 3 minutes and 4 seconds of eating.
Monitor recorded 13 hours 50 minutes and 34 seconds of categorised activities.

Table 3. Amount of specific activity registered by activity monitor and motion sensor camera

In aggregated database from activity monitor, there was a column representing
number of 2.4 second intervals when specific activity was identified. However, for
all registrations of DRINK and LITTER, no time intervals were recorded, only that
activity was identified.

Results from activity monitor are limited compared to “gold standard” of video
analysis. DRINK and LITTER were some of the most underrepresented activities
in  original  training  dataset  for  activity  monitor2.  There  was  no  corresponding
registration for activity monitor and motion sensor camera.

To further investigate lack of correlation, scatter plots were made for drinking
(Figure  4)  and  littering  registrations  (Figure  5).  Those  were  created  to  visualise
distribution of entries  in both  activities from  activity monitor and motion sensor
camera. In some instances, registrations from the activity monitor and the camera
occurred  in  proximity,  suggesting  some  degree  of  agreement  between  the  two
techniques.

However, a significant number of incompatibilities were present as well. Most of
the entries were observed by just one monitoring method and never detected by the
other. With motion sensor camera being established as the gold standard for activity
monitoring, it becomes clear that the activity monitor displays deviations requiring
further  investigation  and  refinement  to  increase  the  accuracy  of  algorithmic
registration.

An unplanned but interesting event was observed during the experiment. On the
18th of May, that is tenth day of the official study, the diet of cats in the shelter room
was changed. Number of portions was decreased from three to two, and brand of
feed was changed. To present a significant increase in registrations of drinking after
the  change  of  feeding  routine,  entries  before  official  start  of  the  study  (from
18/04/2023 to 7/05/2023) were included in the making of Figure 6. Until the day of
diet change experimental unit on average consumed water approximately 0.5 times
per  day,  with  0  being  the  most  frequent  number  of  drinking  per  day.  After  diet
change,  the  average  number  of  drinking  activity  was  4.5,  and  6  being  the  most
frequent number of visits to water bowl in a day. Figure 7 was created to illustrate
dynamics of activities after change in the diet. It shows patterns of drinking, eating,
and littering activities for a duration of what was established as official study.

The predefined category LITTER is used to register the usage of the litter box.
However,  if  results  concern  specific  physiological  function,  then  further
verification is necessary. Upon closely observed usage of litter box, it was found
that 69% of the registered activities corresponded to urination, while the remaining
31% were related to elimination.

5.1  Discussion on results

The results of this study revealed an unexpected finding – a complete absence of
correlation between the data obtained from activity monitor and the motion sensor
camera.  Based  on  the  results  obtained,  the  null  hypothesis  that  there  is  no
correlation  between  the  activities  registered  by  the  activity  monitor  and  the
corresponding  videos  was  supported.  The  analysis  revealed  no  significant
relationship or association between the recorded activities from the activity monitor
and the activities captured in the videos.

Activity monitor did not register drinking and littering activities as well as the
camera  did.  It  highlights  the  need  for  further  investigation  into  the  underlying
causes of distinction between activity monitor and actions observed on video. It is
important to identify the factors that may have contributed to the lack of agreement
between these two sources of data.

One  of  the  goals  of  this  particular  project  was  also  to  create  a  base  of  video
materials of feline behaviour that would be used to further improve the algorithms
by the collar company. While this work regards two specific activities, recordings
include some additional categories as well. This video dataset with corresponding
annotations  could  serve  as  quality  resource  for  training  machine  learning
algorithms. It would allow to better interpret raw accelerometer data resulting in
more  accurate  activity  predictions.  Additionally,  it  could  be  used  as  a  'demo'
platform  with  stimulated  environment  for  algorithm  testing  before  real-world
deployment.

The company was aware of the weaknesses of the algorithm and put in efforts to
improve  it,  such  as  initiating  this  study.  Advancing  algorithms  is  crucial  for  the
accuracy and efficiency of the product.

Results  found  in  Devlin  and  Olausson  (2018)  study,  presented  alignment
between activity monitor and video analysis of 66.39% for Katt 1 and 89.05% for
Katt 2 for five different activities – rest, walk, play, play on the back and force.

Those results were higher than those established in Arvidsson and Spence (2018)
which  showed  a  general  agreement,  between  observed  and  recorded  activity  of
68.4% for Katt 1 and 66.8% for Katt 2 for rest, walk, play, play on the back and
force. Additionally, this research incorporated eating and drinking as one category
for  video  analysis,  with  Katt  1  dedicating  11.5%  of  recorded  time  to  eating  and
drinking, and Katt 2 – 7%. However, there were no records on drinking as a separate
activity.  For  elimination  activities,  neither  the  activity  monitor  nor  the  camera
registered anything for 3 hours 6 minutes 22 seconds of total recorded time for both

32

cats. This category was put into the study just as authors’ suggestion for important
topic and area in future research.

In  Mathiasson  (2019)  an  overall  positive  predictive  value  of  66.0%  was
demonstrated  between  activity  monitor  registrations  via  mobile  app  and  the
observer's registrations based on video footage for predefined activities – walk, run,
play,  eat,  drink,  litter,  groom,  jump,  rest  and  sleep.  Drink  and  litter  had  no
corresponding video records to confirm their occurrence and were not calculated in
the analysis. Average positive predictive value between the observer's recordings
based on video footage and the activity collar's recordings for eating was 61.72%
for 4 out of 6 cats that ate, with correlation coefficient value of 0.72.

While  student  theses  conducted  previously  at  The  Swedish  University  of
Agricultural  Sciences  used  similar  tool,  the  details  and  specific  objectives  differ
from current study. None of those studies analysed drinking separately or registered
elimination actions. The previous theses can be seen as foundation for validation of
activity  monitors  in  cats,  whereas  the  focus  of  present  study  was  to  investigate
specific activities and their application to certain scenario. By narrowing the scope
and  targeting  particular  behaviors  this  study  contributes  to  the  broader
understanding  and  application  of  activity  monitors  in  feline  health  and  disease
management.  The  findings  of  the  previous  theses  provide  valuable,  informative
insights and support for the use of activity monitors, present study builds upon this
basis by exploring the practical implementation and validation in a more specific
manner.

It  is  suspected  that  drinking  and  littering  activities  are  more  complex  than
predefined categories studies in mentioned theses. Because those occur much less
frequent,  it  might  be  more  difficult  to  establish  quality  algorithm  to  correctly
register and analyse DRINK and LITTER. This opens avenues for further research
and refinement of existing models and methodologies. While these activities have
not  been  the  primary  focus  for  the  company,  recent  efforts  have  been  made  to
address these difficulties. As part of its commitment to product improvement, the
company is making efforts to increase the accuracy of algorithmic registration and
analysis of DRINK and LITTER activities.

There is a limited amount of research specifically focused on the validation of
drinking  and  littering  behavior  in  cats  using  activity  monitors.  To  author's
knowledge, no studies have been conducted specifically in this context.

Nonetheless,  the  study  conducted  by  Watanabe  et  al.  (2005)  recorded  a  high
level  of  accuracy  (100%)  in  registering  drinking  behaviors  with  the  activity
monitor.  The  research  included  a  broad  range  of  activities,  including  groom  by
licking, hind claw, and forepaw; eat cat food and half-dried fish; drink water; travel
by walk  trot  and gallop. From 113 minutes of video footage recorded, the study
revealed mean duration of drinking episodes at 45.6 ± 22.6 seconds, taking 3.4% of

33

the total captured footage. The activity monitor effectively registered instances of
drinking with a high degree of accuracy.

It is worth highlighting the findings of studies in different animal species that
have  shown  more  promising  results.  A  pilot  study  by  Williams  et  al.  (2019)
analysed  drinking  behaviour  in  beef  cattle  using  a  neck-mounted  triaxial
accelerometer. The results established that drinking behavior could be categorised
from  standing  (head  up)  with  100%  accuracy.  While  this  study  focused  on
a  different  species,  it  provides  insights  into  the  potential  capabilities  of
accelerometers for monitoring drinking behavior. Although the present study did
not  meet  desired  correlation,  it  serves  as  a  valuable  contribution  to  the  limited
research on this topic in cats.

The presence of a predefined category labeled "LITTER" raises concerns about
accurately interpreting which specific physiological action was registered. LITTER
contains  two  physiological  actions  –  urine  elimination  and  defecation.  Without
a  method  for  counterchecking,  e.g.,  video  capture,  there  is  no  possibility  to
differentiate which specific action was registered as LITTER by activity monitor.
Various methods for monitoring littering were presented, which are not typically
challenging in a household with a single cat. However, in the context of this study,
where one individual cat cohabited with 2 to 4 other cats. It is important to highlight
the  potential  difficulty  associated  with  monitoring  littering  accurately,  without
verifying which individual performed particular physiological action.

This difficulty increases when considering diabetic cats, where monitoring urine
output  holds  significance.  It  crucial  to  emphasize  that  registration  from  activity
monitor alone would not be enough to control urine output in diabetic cat, and as
mentioned before it should be supplemented with additional methods. Referring to
recorded data, registrations captured by activity monitor, video observations from
those days captured 21 activities considered as LITTER that included roughly 76%
of elimination and 24% of defecations actions. Moreover, the presence of more cats
in a household makes accurate monitoring becomes notably complicated due to the
need to not only verify the precise physiological activity that was carried out by the
diabetic cat but also to determine the particular litter box used among several cats,
the procedure of correct monitoring.

This study was conducted in a cat shelter and apart from experimental unit other
cats were present in the room. This made video analysis troublesome particularly
during  eating.  In  such  scenario,  multiple  cats  had  access  to  four  to  eight  bowls.
Often  cats  would  switch  from  one  bowl  to  another  and  continue  eating.  This
happened several times during each meal. It is important to mind the dynamic of
environment  and  interactions  between  animals  to  suit  the  study.  Because  video
analysis became challenging due to risk of overlapping activities, to  address this
a specific criterion was established. Entries were considered as separate activities
if the pause between feeding was longer that three seconds and annotated as two

34

instances of eating. It often took the individual less than three seconds to shift head
to other bowl. However, if the shift contained more movement, like walking to other
bowl, then since it was classified as different activity it was kept separate.

The  concurrent  observations  in  this  study  revealed  that  change  in  feeding
repertoire had an impact on drinking behavior in cats. When on dry food diet cats
drink tend to more water to compensate for lack of dietary moisture when eating
wet food (Zanghi, 2017; 2018). The cat's dependency on drinking water tends to
decrease  with  wet  or  raw  meals,  which  generally  include  over  75%  moisture
(Buckley et al., 2011).

Video  recordings  were  analysed  from  April  18th  to  May  8th  to  capture  all
drinking  activities  captured  in  the  duration  of  this  experiment.  Prior  to  the  diet
change only 14 drinking activities were recorded. However, after the diet change,
an additional 85 drinking activities were observed, giving the total of 99 drinking
activities throughout the entire experiment. This indicates a significant increase in
drinking behavior following the feeding alteration. Specifically, the change in diet
led to a 507.14% increase in drinking activities. This finding confirms that cats on
mostly  dry  food  diet  may  increase  their  voluntary  drinking  by  nearly  six  times,
although their overall water intake may still be 30% less compared to cats on wet
or raw diet (Buckley et al., 2011). These results demonstrate the influence of diet
on drinking behavior and emphasize the importance of considering dietary factors
when assessing and monitoring water intake in cats.

5.2  Potential of use

Despite underwhelming results of this experiment, potential of activity monitors is
undeniable. Activity monitors have vast potential, ranging from analysing behavior
and monitoring physical activity levels to assessing animal welfare and managing
various health disorders. A closer examination of the references used in this study
reveals a variety of studies on benefits of activity monitors across different fields.
Potential  applications  of  activity  monitors have  also  been  increased  by  the
developing technological improvements, such as better data gathering techniques,
higher precision, and the integration of more sensors (Brown, 2013).

While the results obtained from a single animal provide valuable insights and
serve as a pilot study, it is important to acknowledge that despite the limited sample
size, findings  can still contribute to  the broader understanding  of feline drinking
and  littering  behaviors.  Future  studies  could  use  these  results  to  provide  a  more
comprehensive understanding in larger sample size of cats.

Currently,  veterinarians  heavily  rely  on  subjective  measurements  obtained
through questionnaires and medical interviews with owners (Brown et al., 2010;
Karas et al., 2019). However, this approach can be limited by owners' availability,
particularly if they work full time and are unable to observe their pets during the

35

day (Belda et al., 2018). This may result in potential oversight of important signs
of failed health. Activity collars provide a remote solution and allows longer and
continuous data collection, promising for improving monitoring of pets in a home
setting. This is especially advantageous for monitoring activities that occur rarely,
such as drinking. In addition, it is extremely important to recognize the usefulness
of  activity  monitors  for  pet  owners,  that  are  recently  more  demanding  of  higher
standards of reliable tools to assess wellbeing of their animals (Chapa et al., 2020).
The app developed by collar manufacturer has a user-friendly design, is easy to use,
and does not require advanced veterinary knowledge to follow a pet’s health status.
Acquiring data from an activity monitor via a mobile phone is not only quick and
convenient  but  also  simplifies  accessing  important  information  and  real-time
analytics available without  the need for  complicated  calculations  (Zhou and Hu,
2008).  Previous  data  are  stored  which  allows  tracking  and  monitoring  activity
trends over time.

While  this  experiment  focused  on  analysis  of  drinking  and  littering  for  the
control of diabetes, obtained registrations can have potential applications in other
disorders  as  well,  such  as  kidney  disease  and  urinary  tract  infections.  By
continuously  monitoring  drinking,  activity  monitors  can  provide  valuable
information  on  fluid  intake  and  deviations  from  normal  drinking  patterns  or
irregular  littering  can  serve  as  early  warning  signs  of  problems  in  the  urinary
system.  Furthermore,  changes  in  frequency  of  drinking,  eating,  urination,
defecation are behavioural indicators of stress in cats (Bradshaw, 2012).

Cats have a low desire to drink (Buckley et al., 2011) and there is no definition
of  adequate  water  intake  to  recommend  (Zanghi,  2017).  Additionally  fluid
consumption  is  highly  depended  on  various  factors,  such  as  age,  activity  levels,
diet, and is a very individual concept. With broad analysis of cat’s drinking habits,
this  study  commits  to  understanding  aspects  of  feline  hydration,  individual
variability, and the factors that influence their drinking behavior. In a future this
could contribute to the development of guidelines that promote optimal hydration
practices for cats.

Integrating motion sensory camera in longer experiments offers many benefits
to the evenness of work and efficiency of data analysis process. This eliminates the
need to manually analyse video material of complete day-by-day recordings (Karas,
2019). Drinking and littering occur relatively infrequently throughout the day, thus
searching for them in a lengthy file would prolong finalization of research. That
decreases the workload needed to prepare videos for further analysis and allows to
focus the efforts specifically on the area of interest. Additionally, it eliminates the
need  for  costly  serves,  network  capacity  demands  and  minimize  storage
(<www.axis.com>, n.d.).

36

5.3  Limitations and room for improvement

One of the main limitations of this study was the lack of results that would allow
for  broader  and  deeper  data  analysis  and  validation  of  the  activity  monitor.
Specifically,  the  absence  of  significant  correlations  between  data  from  activity
monitor and motion sensor camera limits the extent to which conclusions can be
drawn. This makes it difficult to determine the reliability and validity of activity
monitor in identifying and quantifying the desired activities.

It  is  crucial  to  recognize  the  need  for  further  research  and  improvement  to
strengthen  the  validity  and  value  of  activity  monitors  in  similar  studies.  The
challenges  arise  when  capturing  and  analysing  infrequent  behaviors,  such  as
drinking and littering. Developing competent algorithms for accelerometer-based
monitoring  is  therefore  complex  and  demands  advanced  analytical  tools  to
accurately detect and quantify various activities. Currently, video recording serves
as  the  gold  standard  in  animal  activity  monitoring.  The  absence  of  a  strong
correlation in results could be attributed to the underdeveloped algorithm, which
limits  the  ability  of  activity  monitor  to  accurately  identify  and  interpret  specific
activities,  especially  those  that  occur  less  frequently.  The  potential  of  activity
monitors  is  promising,  however  there  is  a  need  for  algorithmic  advancement  to
refine and develop this technology.

Additionally,  this  could  indicate  the  potential  value  in  exploring  alternative
technologies, such as  advanced sensors  offering objective measurements  of time
spent at specific locations, in this study close proximity of bowls and littering box.
There  isn't  yet  a  commonly  used  standardized  method  to  measure  physical
activity  with  wearable  accelerometers  (Karas  et  al.,  2019).  Moreover,  the
interpretation  of accelerometer data is  highly influenced by individual variations
and  characteristics.  This  emphasizes  the  need  for  further  research  to  establish
standardized  methods  and  develop  criteria  for  interpreting  and  comparing
accelerometer data. In the context of this experiment, which focused on one cat, it
is essential to acknowledge that obtained results may not be fully representative in
a larger population. Given that drinking and littering are very individual traits, this
is  particularly  significant.  While  the  results  of  this  study  offer  valuable  insight,
future studies with larger sample sizes are necessary to obtain more comprehensive
and generalized data.

Devices that are attached to a collar are movable and not fixed to the body. This
may result in inaccurate acceleration readings, which would reduce the accuracy of
the body movement measurements (Dickinson et al., 2020). Additionally, the fact
that some cat’s simply do not  tolerate collars is  important  drawback to  use such
a tool. Alternative methods or strategies may need to be explored for monitoring
the activity levels and behaviors of cats that do not tolerate collars.

Compared to other predefined categories of activity drinking and littering occurs
undoubtably least often. To obtain significant results the experiment should be run

37

for  a  longer  period.  To  minimise  workload  for  a  video  analysis  this  study  used
motion  sensor  camera.  However,  some  limitations  came  along.  Firstly,  due  to
positioning of the camera, sometimes it was difficult to interpret start and end of
activity.  The  cat  approaching  water  bowl  did  not  equal  to  start  of  drinking,
especially  since  the  individual  used  in  this  experiment  often  took  longer to  start
drinking.  In  some  cases,  a  camera  with  horizontal  level  of  recording  would  be
appreciated,  because  there  was  no  possibility  to  countercheck  if  activity  started.
Secondly,  because  motion  sensor  camera  is  triggered  by  movement  in  designed
area, as a result sometimes recording stopped if there was no pronounced motion,
yet experimental unit was still in a frame using feeding bowl. In a few instances
recording was cut short but those were counted as errors and deleted.

One limitation of the study was related to the design of the AXIS software used
for recording, specifically the lack of a "mass download" option, which would made
the  process  of  saving  all  recorded  materials  time-consuming.  As  a  result,  the
observer  had  to  selectively  store  only  the  recordings  with  activities  of  interest,
which limited the availability of additional materials for potential future use and
analysis. Additionally, depending on the size of the memory card and the file sizes
themselves,  there  were  limitations  on  the  number  of  materials  that  could  be
registered. Another troublesome aspect in this study, was the overlapping of stored
videos after 30 days, posing a risk of losing important materials.

The battery life of 3 to 4 weeks can be considered a potential practical limitation
worth mentioning (Chapa et al., 2020). While it may not significantly impact the
overall findings  or validity of the study, it is  important  to  acknowledge that  one
must remember to charge the device regularly. Failure to do so could result in data
loss if the monitor turns off due to an empty battery.

38

6.  Conclusions

This study was conducted with the general aim to validate the registrations of an
activity  monitor  designed  for  cats,  specifically  its  effectiveness  in  detecting
drinking and littering activities. The results revealed that there was no correlation
between  the  data  obtained  from  the  activity  monitor  and  the  video  observations
from the motion sensor camera.

These  findings  support  the  null  hypothesis,  which  expected  that  there  is  no
significant correlation between the activities registered by the activity monitor and
the  corresponding  videos.  While  these  results  may  be  considered  negative,  they
offer valuable information on activity monitoring and potential for early detection
of health conditions in felines.

The results of this study contribute to the limited research on the validation of
drinking  and littering  behavior in  cats  using activity monitors. It  emphasizes the
complexity  of  accurately  registering  and  monitoring  these  activities.  While  the
results  may  be  specific  to  the  individual  cat  in  this  study, they  provide  valuable
insights and serve as a pilot study for future research in this area. The limitations
and challenges encountered in this study underline the need for further refinement
and improvement in this technology, but acknowledge the valuable insights activity
monitors provide and their role in future research.

Negative validation results imply that the activity monitor might not effectively
register relevant behaviors or physiological changes linked to diabetes. However,
despite underwhelming findings it should not rule out all potential applications in
monitoring  feline  behaviors  and  managing  health  disorders  remain  promising.
Activity  monitors  still  hold  the  potential  to  support  the  management  of  feline
diabetes and monitor key activities associated with this disorder, especially due to
the  advantage  of  remote  capabilities.  By  providing  objective  data  on  physical
activity levels, they could support control of effectiveness of treatment plans, and
promote overall health and well-being in diabetic cats.

Until  further  development  and  refinement,  using  activity  monitor  to  control
drinking  and  littering  may  need  reconsideration  due  to  lack  of  correlation  with
observation,  however,
that  advancements  and
improvements could lead to more effective equipment in the future.

appreciate you greatly. And thank you for considering adopting a cat.

I  dziękuję  moim  najbliższym  –  pomimo,  że  mało  rozumiecie  co  właściwie
studiuję, jestem wiecznie wdzięczna, że zawsze we mnie wierzycie, w moje pasje,
marzenia i decyzje. I że czasem ufacie mi w tym bardziej, niż ja ufam sobie. Mam
nadzieję, że jesteście ze mnie dumni.

(And thank you to my close family – despite that you understand little of what I am actually studying,

I am forever grateful that you can still believe in me, in my passions, dreams and decisions. And

that in this you trust me more than I trust myself. I hope I made you proud).

I really did it!
Thank you all from the bottom of my heart,

9.  Popular science summary

Keeping pets healthy is becoming more important among animal owners. With an
increase  in  owners’  awareness  about  the  physical  and  mental  health  of  their
companions, there is  a growing demand for higher standards of tools to  monitor
everyday habits, which leads to development and introduction of new technologies
into the market. Activity monitors that use accelerometers provide remote insights
into the physical activity of animals.

This study focused on registering drinking and littering patterns with an activity
monitor in cats to see how effective this equipment is and compared the results with
video recordings. Monitoring these habits could assist in detection of early signals
of ongoing health problems, such as diabetes.

One cat was equipped with an activity monitor for over 48 days during which
thousands of activity data were collected. Selected 671 entries related to drinking
and littering were compared with video recordings from a motion sensor camera.

The results revealed that the data from the activity monitor didn't match the video

observations from sensor motion camera.

That does not necessarily mean that the technology failed. The potential to use
activity  monitors  to  learn  more  about  pets’  behaviour  and  health  is  still present.
However,  more  research  is  needed  to  understand  why  the  results  were  not  as
expected, meaning why activity monitor did not register most of the drinking and
littering actions. One possibility is that since they are so rare especially in cats, more
work  is  required  to  train  the  algorithms  to  efficiently  register  these  actions.  To
conclude, activity monitors hold a promise to monitor pets health and well-being.
