Many predator species make regular excursions from near-surface waters to the twilight
(200 to 1,000 m) and midnight (1,000 to 3,000 m) zones of the deep pelagic ocean.
While the occurrence of signiﬁcant vertical movements into the deep ocean has
evolved independently across taxonomic groups, the functional role(s) and ecological
signiﬁcance of these movements remain poorly understood. Here, we integrate results
from satellite tagging efforts with model predictions of deep prey layers in the North
Atlantic Ocean to determine whether prey distributions are correlated with vertical
habitat use across 12 species of predators. Using 3D movement data for 344 individuals
who traversed nearly 1.5 million km of pelagic ocean in >42,000 d, we found that
nearly every tagged predator frequented the twilight zone and many made regular trips
to the midnight zone. Using a predictive model, we found clear alignment of predator
depth use with the expected location of deep pelagic prey for at least half of the
predator species. We compared high-resolution predator data with shipboard acoustics
and selected representative matches that highlight the opportunities and challenges in
the analysis and synthesis of these data. While not all observed behavior was consistent
with estimated prey availability at depth, our results suggest that deep pelagic biomass
likely has high ecological value for a suite of commercially important predators in the
open ocean. Careful consideration of the disruption to ecosystem services provided by
pelagic food webs is needed before the potential costs and beneﬁts of proceeding with
extractive activities in the deep ocean can be evaluated.

Marine ﬁsheries are concentrated in productive coastal waters that cover a relatively
small area of the global ocean. The open ocean beyond continental shelves represents a
considerably larger habitat, accounting for 80% of the global biosphere and supporting
as much as 50% of the total marine ﬁsh biomass (1). Most of this ﬁsh biomass
resides in the deep ocean where it has remained relatively free from industrial-scale
ﬁsheries exploitation. Recent evidence suggests that the ocean twilight zone alone (the
mesopelagic; 200 to 1,000 m) may contain 7 to 10 billion metric tons (2), and other
work points to the potential for even higher biomass in the midnight, or bathypelagic,
zone [1,000 to 3,000 m; (3, 4)]. However, the deep ocean and its inhabitants are hidden
from many traditional observation platforms, and quantifying the ecosystem services
that the region provides, including supporting higher trophic level predator populations,
remains challenging (5). For instance, much of our understanding of the vertical and
horizontal distribution of deep pelagic communities stems from observations in which
aggregations of ﬁsh and invertebrates at depth scatter sound waves produced by shipboard
echosounders (e.g., refs. 6–8). However, the lack of taxonomic resolution when analyzing
remote acoustic measurements generates large uncertainties around our current estimates
of deep pelagic biomass. Traditional net-based surveys suffer similarly large uncertainties
when estimating biomass due to active avoidance of even large scientiﬁc net systems
by nektonic pelagic organisms (9). Taken together, our inability to constrain biomass
estimates in the deep ocean highlights a lack of knowledge concerning the ecological
structure and functioning of the largest ecosystem on the planet.

The proliferation of animal-borne electronic tag technologies has resulted in
widespread deployment of in situ sensors on marine animals (e.g., refs. 10 and 11). Data
from these deployments have generated insight into deep pelagic community structure
(12), oceanography (13, 14), biophysical drivers that modulate connectivity between epi-
and mesopelagic ecosystems (15), and potential trophic interactions occurring in the deep
ocean (16, 17). Recent work has shown that nearly every predator species studied using

Signiﬁcance

The deep ocean likely provides a
wide range of valuable ecosystem
services to the planet and society
but largely remains enigmatic due
to the size and inaccessibility
of this region. We use tagged
animals as “evolutionarily
informed” oceanographers to
demonstrate that the deep ocean
is a critical habitat for a number
of predators, including sharks,
tunas, and billfish. Our data
suggest that this zone may
provide previously unrecognized
ecosystem services to a suite of
commercially and ecologically
important predator species.
Climate-induced changes and
potential extraction of deep
ocean resources suggest that this
critical link between the largest
fish biomass on Earth and top
predators may be in jeopardy.

the behavior has evolved independently across marine mammals,
reptiles, birds, teleost ﬁshes, and elasmobranchs [reviewed in
ref. 18]. This ability to access the deep pelagic across diverse
taxonomic groups represents a signiﬁcant opportunity to leverage
tagged animals as “evolutionarily informed” oceanographers (e.g.,
ref. 19) and provide important insights into the ecology of the
deep ocean.

Foraging is likely a primary functional role of deep ocean
habitat used by predators that are typically observed in the
near surface. Evidence for marine mammals foraging at depth
is, in some cases, unequivocal (17, 20), but conﬁrmation for
most taxa remains less certain (18). Several studies have used
various indicators to identify putative foraging at depth. For
example, the metabolic heat generated by digestion (the heat
increment of feeding, HIF) in lamnid sharks and some tunas
can be used under certain conditions to identify foraging events,
e.g., southern blueﬁn tuna, (21). Other studies have combined
electronic tagging and acoustics to align vertical movements
by ﬁsh predators and associated mesopelagic prey (22, 23).
Together, these studies highlight the potential importance of
ecological connectivity between surface waters and the deep
ocean. However, quantifying the potential ecosystem services
provided by the mesopelagic community, including supporting
pelagic food webs containing commercially important ﬁshes and
marine mammals and the role in the biological carbon pump,
remains a key question with signiﬁcant scientiﬁc, management,
and policy implications (5, 24–26).

Here, we synthesized data from electronic tags, shipboard
oceanographic sampling, Earth-observing satellites, and data-
assimilating ocean models to explore the potential signiﬁcance
of deep diving for large pelagic predators. We assessed ver-
tical habitat use with the tag data and developed a model
framework to quantify abiotic and biotic drivers of this behav-
ior. Observed predator movements were collocated to quasi-
concurrent shipboard acoustics data from a global database
of oceanographic surveys to further examine speciﬁc predator
interactions with scattering layers. The unique combination of
tools and analyses allowed us to quantify species-speciﬁc func-
tional relationships with environmental drivers and explore the
impacts of the biotic and abiotic variability on a suite of pelagic
predators.

Results

We analyzed data from a total of 344 electronic tags that yielded
3D movement data spanning 46,659 tracking days from 12
species of bony and cartilaginous ﬁsh predators in the North
Atlantic Ocean (SI Appendix, Table S1 and Fig. 1A), including
sharks (white, Carcharodon carcharias; basking, Cetorhinus max-
imus; tiger, Galeocerdo cuvier; shortﬁn mako, Isurus oxyrinchus;
porbeagle, Lamna nasus; whale, Rhincodon typus; blue, Prionace
glauca); rays (Chilean devil, Mobula tarapacana); tunas (bigeye,
Thunnus obesus; yellowﬁn, Thunnus albacares); and billﬁshes
(blue marlin, Makaira nigricans; swordﬁsh, Xiphias gladius).
Individual tracks averaged 134 d (range of mean durations = 62
to 231 d from 11 to 86 tags per species). Considering only 2D
movements, individuals cumulatively traversed 1.55 million km
of the pelagic ocean averaging 4,600 km per individual (range
of species-speciﬁc mean track distance = 2,074 to 10,318 km;
SI Appendix, Table S1).

The tag data indicated that the deep pelagic ocean is an
important habitat for all species tracked in this study. Maximum
recorded depth exceeded 900 m for all species and 1,500 m for

seven of the 12 species (SI Appendix, Table S2). The among-
species mean of daily maximum depth indicated widespread
use of the deep pelagic ocean throughout the North Atlantic
(overall mean 914 m, s.d. 420 m; Fig. 1B). Maximum depths
(SI Appendix, Fig. S1) and daily occupation of the deep ocean
(Fig. 2 and SI Appendix, Fig. S2) revealed, however, that vertical
habitat use was variable among species, ranging from >60%
daily residency at depth (deeper than 200 m) for basking sharks
to <5% for blue marlin, tiger sharks, whale sharks, yellowﬁn
tuna, and Chilean devil rays. Despite the variability across taxa,
all species exhibited examples of individuals spending at least
50% of the day in the mesopelagic, and six species had examples
of days for which 100% of time was spent deeper than 200 m
(SI Appendix, Table S2).

High-resolution time series data (1 to 600 s resolution) were
available for a subset of 219 tagged individuals representing

Predators revealed a broad spectrum in how they use deep pelagic habitat. There are clear species-specific patterns in how tagged individuals use the
deep ocean: from limited time at depth (e.g., blue marlin, A) to periodic “dives” from the surface to deep ocean characterized by less overall time at depth (e.g.,
Chilean devil ray, B, bigeye tuna, C, and blue shark, D) to consistent daily use of deep habitats (e.g., swordfish, E) to seasonal residency in the ocean twilight
zone (e.g., basking sharks, F ). See SI Appendix, Fig. S2 for all species.

13,330 tracking days (∼30% of total days; SI Appendix, Table
S2). The time series data captured 11,922 complete deep dive
proﬁles in which an individual was recorded moving below the
epipelagic (>200 m) before returning to the epipelagic after a pe-
riod of time. The number of deep dives per day averaged 0.4 to 4.2
across the study species while individuals made as many as 6 to 24
of these dives in a single day (SI Appendix, Table S2 and Fig. S3).
A hierarchical generalized additive model found alignment
of vertical habitat use with the predicted depth of the primary
deep scattering layer (DSL, Fig. 3 and SI Appendix, Table S3)
as modulated by local oceanographic conditions (represented by
ΔT, change in temperature between 220 m and the surface)
and species-speciﬁc physiology. The model also highlighted
signiﬁcant variability among individuals within and across species
and an apparent disconnect between predators and the DSL
for other species. To quantify the relationship of the observed
vertical habitat use relative to the expected depth of the DSL, we
developed the metric Z (cid:48) (Eq. 1) where values of Z (cid:48) signiﬁcantly
> 0 (blues in Fig. 3B) or < 0 (reds in Fig. 3B) indicate depth of
tagged individuals signiﬁcantly deeper or shallower than the DSL,
respectively. For example, despite some use of deeper waters, blue
marlin and tiger sharks primarily occupied the upper mesopelagic
and did not regularly intersect with expected DSL depths (95
and 79% of days with Z (cid:48) < −200 m, respectively; red colors
in Fig. 3B). In contrast, swordﬁsh, shortﬁn mako sharks, and
white sharks all appear to track DSL depth (51, 41, and 53%
of days with Z (cid:48) ± 100 m, respectively), largely independent
of temperature. For blue and basking sharks, depth preferences
tracked DSL depth but were modulated by thermal constraints
whereby tagged individuals moved deeper as ΔT decreased.
Basking sharks were consistently observed well below expected

DSL depths (52% of days with Z (cid:48) > +200 m) when the DSL
was located ∼400 m or deeper.

To further explore how scattering layers might inﬂuence
predator behavior, we collocated the tag dataset to 361 research
expeditions on vessels equipped with active acoustics systems
operating at frequencies of 75 kHz or lower, allowing them to
insonify the DSL. The vessel data represented 3,892 d at sea,
spanning much of the North Atlantic (Appendix, Fig. S4), and
resulted in >290,000 matches where a ship and a tagged predator
were within 100 km and ±30 d of each other. We selected four
representative ﬁsh-ship matches (for different predator species) to
highlight the opportunities and inherent challenges in the analysis
of these data (Fig. 4). The blue shark example suggested that the
tagged individual was aligned with the depth of the migrating
mesopelagic community (∼80 to 100 m) at night. The shark’s
daytime behavior suggested occupation of a portion of the water
column that contained a scattering layer that was acoustically
weaker than the primary DSL below. Tag-derived detections
of bioluminescence events indicated the presence of potential
prey (Fig. 4A and Materials and Methods). In contrast to diurnal
variability observed in the blue shark example, data from a tagged
swordﬁsh highlighted tight coupling between the predator’s
vertical habitat use and migration of the primary DSL from ∼500
m during daytime to the surface mixed layer at night (Fig. 4B).
The dive proﬁle recovered from a tagged basking shark revealed
considerable time spent below the effective range of the shipboard
acoustic instrument during the day, but a nighttime portion of
the example suggests: 1) nighttime overlap with the migrating
DSL in the near-surface; 2) potential repeated interaction with
a non-migrating deep scattering layer at night around 450 m;
and 3) additional overlap with a patchy shallow scattering layer

explanatory variables in a model to predict daily 95th percentile of predator daytime depth distribution (predicted q95, Pq95) for comparison against Zq95,
the observed q95 (A). The distribution of model-derived Z(cid:48) (model-predicted q95 relative to the predicted mean DSL depth; Eq. 1) varies as a function of DSL
depths and water column thermal structure (B). Swordfish vertical habitat use, for example, is clearly influenced by DSL depth (as evidenced by the coupling
of predictions and observations in A) but is largely unaﬀected by temperature as Z(cid:48) remains unchanged over a ∼10 ◦C range in ΔT (in B). In contrast, model-
predicted q95 for blue sharks also indicates strong agreement with the observations (in A); yet, while Z(cid:48) indicates the predicted q95 relationship to mean DSL
depth is consistent for low values of ΔT (muted colors, Z(cid:48) ± 50), it becomes increasingly disconnected as ΔT indicates larger temperature gradients (saturated
red, Z(cid:48) ∼ −200).

at ∼250 m (Fig. 4C). It is worth noting that the basking
shark example was hindered by strong noise in the acoustics
data (light colored region centered around 18:00) which can
result from changes in weather conditions and interference from
other onboard instrumentation, highlighting a primary challenge
in making inference from shipboard acoustic instrumentation.
Finally, the shortﬁn mako shark example identiﬁed movement
throughout the upper mixed layer at night while overlapping
with the migrating component of the DSL. During daytime,
the shark was primarily located in the surface ocean but made
multiple, relatively rapid dives that terminate at the top of the
primary DSL in this region (∼300 m and Fig. 4D).

Discussion

The deep ocean provides a wide range of vital ecosystem services
to the planet and society (5) but remains largely unexplored and
enigmatic. Recent research initiatives have sought to improve our
understanding of deep ocean ecosystems amid international calls
to action (24, 27). However, these efforts have often overlooked
links between midwater animals and a group of large pelagic
predators that are targets of large commercial ﬁsheries, bycatch,
or species of conservation concern. While nearly all species
studied here are considered primarily epipelagic, our results
demonstrate that all predators occupied the deep pelagic ocean
to some degree, yet some did so less frequently or spent less
time at depth. The density of prey in some deep scattering
layers (28) suggests the potential for highly efﬁcient foraging
that could skew the relationship between time spent at depth

and the relative importance of mesopelagic foraging. Indeed,
studies of catch-at-depth for many of the species evaluated here
indicate high catches in deep waters where tag records suggest that
minimal time is spent (29); however, additional work is needed to
quantify the relative importance of deep versus shallow foraging
modes.

Our results demonstrate that the deep ocean is a critical habitat
for large pelagic predators despite their range of physiological
capabilities and limitations to accessing the ocean twilight
and midnight zones. The ocean’s twilight zone, in particular,
is typiﬁed by a strong primary DSL that may contain 10 to
100x more biomass than annual global ﬁshery landings (2) and
includes a number of important prey species, such as lanternﬁshes
and squids, that are consumed by most pelagic predators (30).
Taken together, our results suggest the frequent occupation of the
deep pelagic ocean by several predator taxa in this study is likely
a function of the high biomass in this zone and is modulated
by overlying oceanographic conditions for which some species
have specialized adaptations (e.g., endothermic capacities, SI
Appendix, Table S1). For example, swordﬁsh are well known to
closely track diel vertical migration of the DSL and spend nearly
all daylight hours at depth (31–33). These vertical movements
are facilitated by a number of adaptations that make them a
formidable predator in the dark, cold environment of the deep
pelagic ocean, e.g., thermal plasticity, (34); visual acuity, (35).
Bigeye tuna and blue sharks also spent signiﬁcant time at depth
but exhibit multiple, shorter dives per day. While bigeye tuna can
also alter whole-body heat transfer, their time at depth appears
limited by abrupt termination of dives when muscle temperature

as a key driver of deep ocean habitat use. These data are
consistent with observations of active foraging at depth by
some deep-diving marine mammals (17, 43). However, previous
work has also pointed to other potential functional roles of
these vertical movements, including predator avoidance (44)
and navigation (45), among others (reviewed in ref. 18). For
example, our model results highlight an apparent disconnect
between predicted location of the DSL and predator dive depths
for devil rays and whale sharks and signiﬁcant variability in this
relationship for basking and porbeagle sharks that both exhibited
prolonged periods of deep ocean residency. This mismatch may
be partially explained by the diet of ﬁlter-feeding predators
(e.g., basking and whale sharks) that target zooplankton as these
prey are not apparent in the low-frequency acoustics used to
study deep scattering layers. In addition, a number of large
pelagic predators, including whale sharks and mobulid rays, are
known to use passive glides to descend, interspersed with active
ascents, to optimize movement efﬁciency (46–49), which may
represent a distinct functional role for occupying the deep ocean.
Theoretical and empirical evidence has shown that this passive
gliding, particularly in negatively buoyant animals, can result
in signiﬁcant energetic advantages (50). Furthermore, previous
studies have indicated thermoregulation both as a modulator of
and motivation for occupying the deep ocean for certain species
in speciﬁc oceanographic regimes. For example, porbeagles are
known to overwinter at depth in warm Gulf Stream water (51)
and Atlantic blueﬁn tuna may exploit deep pelagic habitats
to reduce energetic cost of swimming against strong currents
and to reduce excess heat during spawning migrations in the
(sub)tropical Gulf of Mexico (52). The complex relationship
between predator behavior and expected DSL depths for these
species demonstrates the need for additional work to disentangle
the relative inﬂuence of foraging and thermal preferences and
adaptations, along with their spatiotemporal variability.

While most of the study species showed correlations between
vertical movements and DSL depth, we found no evidence for a
link between DSL location and dive behavior in blue marlin
and tiger sharks. These species are likely limited in their
thermal and/or visual capabilities at depth (33, 53, 54) and
only occasionally occupy the upper mesopelagic or conduct
relatively short “bounce” dives to deeper habitats (e.g., refs.
55 and 56). Some research has suggested that species facing
signiﬁcant physiological limitations and/or exhibiting frequent
surface occupation during daytime may rely on the nighttime
migration of scattering layer prey into the epipelagic (56–58).
This interpretation is supported, in some cases, by mesopelagic
prey items in the diet of truly epipelagic species, e.g., shortbill
spearﬁsh: (59, 60). However, recent work suggests that some
predators may also target shallow scattering layers in the open
ocean during the day (61, 62), which may be a more common
strategy among surface-oriented, or otherwise physiologically
limited, pelagic predators than previously recognized.

Scattering layers are often coherent patches of ﬁsh and
invertebrate nekton in the pelagic ocean that occupy speciﬁc
light “comfort zones” (7). Most research to date has focused on
the primary DSL, which is largely thought to be a ubiquitous
feature throughout the global ocean but with a number of
complexities, including multiple modes in the “primary” DSL
(63) and varying proportions of migrating and non-migratory
individuals and migration timing (64). This complexity likely
contributes to the strikingly divergent predictions of a very simple
DSL depth metric in this study derived from three published
models (SI Appendix, Figs. S5 and S6). Our mean representation

decreases to ∼17 ◦C (36). As an ectotherm, blue sharks face clear
thermal constraints to the length of time that they can spend
in the twilight zone (37, 38). The inability to maintain elevated
internal temperature likely contributes to the observed gradient
of increasing time at depth from north to south in our study
area as water temperatures also increase at depth (decreasing ΔT)
as one moves closer to the equator, potentially releasing them
from thermal constraints to foraging (15). Similarly, low oxygen
at depth in the eastern Atlantic may limit the vertical extent
and/or time at depth of many predator species relative to the
normoxic conditions elsewhere in the North Atlantic (39, 40).
Together, the observed patterns of deep ocean habitat use are
both consistent with previous ﬁndings (18, 41, 42) and suggest
that the vertical movements of pelagic predators are responding
to variability in the distributions of mesopelagic prey in the open
ocean.

of the phenomenon. However, our model remains naive to
variations in biomass, spatial, and temporal patchiness and
differing community composition within the DSL and among
other scattering layers, which are all too poorly constrained to use
for this work. Nevertheless, a comparison between the geometric
means of the predicted DSL for the case studies (shown in Fig. 4)
shows that they differ from local maxima in acoustic backscatter
by only 1 to 86 m (SI Appendix, Fig. S6 and Table S4). This
comparison, though, is limited to the depths that can be observed
with 75-kHz acoustics. For example, in addition to shallow,
transient scattering layers and the primary deep scattering layer,
there is also growing evidence for additional DSLs at the meso-to-
bathypelagic boundary around 1,000 m (3, 65), consistent with
some of the vertical habitat use of basking sharks shown here.
Furthermore, some top predators are known to make extreme
deep dives well below the primary DSL to >2,000 m, e.g.,
elephant seals, (66); beaked whales, (67); Chilean devil rays,
this study and (68). While we lack an estimate of global biomass
in the bathypelagic, recent work found higher biomass than in
mesopelagic waters above the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (3) and others
found that biomass may be signiﬁcant even into the abyssal
pelagic to ∼4,000 m, (69). Similarly, the global distribution
and biogeography of shallow (∼150 to 350 m) scattering layers
remain poorly understood, highlighting how little we know about
the ocean’s midwater ecosystems and the limitations of current
approaches.

Regardless of these complexities, our ﬁnding that nearly all
species studied here frequented the deep pelagic ocean shows
that this zone may provide underappreciated ecosystem services
to a suite of commercially and ecologically important pelagic
ﬁsh species. We were unable to directly quantify foraging at
depth, and therefore, the absolute value of deep resources to
these predators remains unknown. However, our results suggest
that mesopelagic forage species contribute signiﬁcantly to the
energy budgets of pelagic predators and highlight the need for
additional research to better characterize the ecological value
of this connectivity, particularly in light of climate-induced
changes to midwater ecosystems (70, 71) and planned harvest
of mesopelagic resources (72, 73). Despite extensive diet data
supporting the importance of mesopelagic prey for a suite of
predator taxa [reviewed in ref. 30], the relative importance of deep
versus shallow foraging modes within and among taxa remains
largely unknown. Uncertainties in the relative importance of
pelagic prey have led to the continued discounting of large
marine predators as mediators of carbon export via the biological
pump or, if considered, have been assumed to be primarily
epipelagic foragers [reviewed in ref. 74]. Our results show that
many predators engage in regular vertical migrations of hundreds
to thousands of meters between the surface and the ocean
twilight and midnight zones. Better accounting is needed to more
accurately quantify the potentially signiﬁcant role of predators
and the impacts of associated ﬁsheries for predators (75) and
prey (72, 73) in the marine carbon cycle. Together, the overlap
in ongoing ﬁshing effort and pelagic predator distributions
(76), expected climate-induced changes in pelagic ecosystems
(70, 71, 77), and the potential extraction of mesopelagic biomass
(72, 73) suggest that this critical link may be in jeopardy.

Materials and Methods

Satellite Tagging and Data. We analyzed data from 344 deployments of
pop-up satellite archival transmitting (PSAT) tags on 12 species of teleost
and elasmobranch predators in the North Atlantic, including sharks (white,

Carcharodon carcharias, n = 24; basking, Cetorhinus maximus, n = 38; tiger,
Galeocerdo cuvier, n = 10; shortﬁn mako, Isurus oxyrinchus, n = 19; porbeagle,
Lamna nasus, n = 17; blue, Prionace glauca, n = 41; and whale, Rhincodon
typus, n = 11), rays (Chilean devil ray, Mobula tarapacana, n = 16), tunas
(Bigeye tuna, Thunnus obesus, n = 16; yellowﬁn tuna, Thunnus albacares,
n = 86), and billﬁsh (blue marlin, Makaira nigricans, n = 48; swordﬁsh, Xiphias
gladius, n = 18). These tags collect data on vertical movements and light levels
that can be used to estimate the position of tagged individuals. A subset of
individuals tagged with PSATs were also equipped with satellite-linked location-
only tags (n = 25) which were used to provide spatial movement information.
For most individuals (n = 319), we used a combination of state-space modeling
approaches to estimate daily locations and associated uncertainty for each
tag based on sunrise and sunset times and environmental measurements.
All vertical data were ﬁltered to include only those periods in which the
tracking data indicated the tagged individual was in water at least 2,000 m
deep.

Quantifying Biotic and Abiotic Drivers of Vertical Habitat Use. We
assessed abiotic and biotic drivers of vertical habitat use by pelagic predators
with hierarchical generalized additive models [HGAMs, (78)] to determine how
the environment modulates connections between surface and deep ocean
ecosystems. This approach enables explicit testing of species-speciﬁc responses
in a single, quantitative framework that facilitates direct comparability across
taxa. We used the daily 95th percentile of the daytime depth distribution
from predator tags [Zq95, see Eq. 1] as the independent variable and the
change in temperature from the surface to 220 m (ΔT) from the Global
Ocean Physics Reanalysis (GLORYS) model as the abiotic dependent variable.
Given the variability in predicted DSL depths from three previously published
models (63, 79, 80), we used the geometric mean of model-predicted
mean DSL depth as the dependent biotic variable (ZDSL, see Eq. 1 and SI
Appendix, Fig. S5). The HGAMs included species-level intercepts and individuals
as random effect intercepts. Model parameter estimation used restricted
maximum likelihood (REML). Model validation included checking quantile-
quantile, residual vs linear predictor, residual frequency, response vs. ﬁtted
value, and autocorrelation function plots plus Moran’s I for the distribution,
heteroscedasticity, and temporal/spatial autocorrelation of the residuals. Finally,
we developed a metric to quantify the relative inﬂuence of biotic and abiotic
drivers on vertical habitat use of predators

Z(cid:48) = Zq95(x, y, t) − ZDSL(x, y, t),

[1]

where Z(cid:48) is the observed or modeled depth anomaly of each dive, Zq95 is the daily
95th percentile of the daytime depth distribution for each tagged individual,
and ZDSL is the expected geometric mean depth of the deep scattering layer.
This metric indicates when predator dive depth is deeper (Z(cid:48) < 0, blue colors
in Fig. 3B) or shallower (Z(cid:48) > 0, red colors in Fig. 3B) than the expected depth
of the DSL and was used to explore the gradient of impact that water column
thermal structure has on the link between predator behavior and biotic drivers.

Example Scattering Layer Interactions. We pooled shipboard acoustic data
from three global and regional databases and collocated the resulting ship
transects to tracks of tagged predators. We used shipboard data collected within
30 d and 100 km from predator observations. Many of the resulting matches
contained acoustic data of variable (and often insufﬁcient) quality to represent
a complete diel cycle. Therefore, we chose to focus on a set of case studies
corresponding to predator species with different physiology and habitat use.
For each case study, we used the acoustic and tag data corresponding to the
closest match in time and space, prioritizing the closest observations in time
within the 100-km radius. The examples were derived from acoustic backscatter
amplitude collected by 75-kHz Acoustic Doppler Current Proﬁlers (ADCPs) that
was converted to uncalibrated mean volume backscattering strength [S∗
v dB re
m−1; (81–83)]. A subset of predator tags were physically recovered, yielding
high-resolution time series of relative light levels that were used to detect
bioluminescent events. We prioritized these tags in the examples presented.
