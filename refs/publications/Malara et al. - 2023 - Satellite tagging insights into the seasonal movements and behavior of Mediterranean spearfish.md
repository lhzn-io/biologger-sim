The Mediterranean spearﬁsh (Tetrapturus belone) is a highly migratory predator,
also exploited by commercial and recreational ﬁsheries although its catches are
poorly reported. The ﬁshing pressure on this species is currently unknown
because catch and landing data are fragmentary. Furthermore, more
ecological
information (e.g. migratory movements) is needed to establish
eventual management measures, and ICCAT has not examined the population
status yet. Understanding species migratory movements is crucial for addressing
conservation challenges and supporting management decisions. In this study we
investigated the migratory movements, seasonal patterns, vertical behavior, and
thermal preference of T. belone, with the aim to improve information on its
ecology and behavior. Overall, six individuals were tagged in the Strait of Messina
and Tyrrhenian Sea with pop-up satellite tags and their movements were mainly
restricted to the central Mediterranean. Utilization distributions derived from
geolocation revealed an overall and seasonal importance of the Tyrrhenian Sea
and Strait of Sicily, as well as variability in winter habitat use. While the ﬁsh
exhibited similar depth preference, spending the majority of time at depths ≤ 10
m, we observed that the Mediterranean spearﬁsh is also able to perform sporadic
deep dives below 200 m. Vertical movement showed a bimodal pattern common
in other billﬁsh species, characterized by occupation of shallower, warmer waters
during the night and deeper, cooler waters during the day. This research
increases knowledge on the migration ecology and habitat preference of T.
belone which is important for management of this understudied species.

1 Introduction

Billﬁshes (swordﬁsh, sailﬁsh, spearﬁshes and marlins) are large
highly migratory predators including 12 species and two families,
i.e., Xiphiidae and Istiophoridae (Nakamura, 1985). They are
considered important ﬁshery resources in many countries
(Collette et al., 2011; Pons et al., 2017), with populations
impacted by both commercial and recreational ﬁshing (Holland
et al., 1998; Ditton and Stoll, 2003). Globally, less than half of billﬁsh
stocks exhibit healthy biomass levels and nearly a quarter are still
experiencing overﬁshing (Pons et al., 2017). However there are
cases (i.e. most spearﬁshes) where catch data are discontinuously
reported and stocks have not yet been assessed (Punt et al., 2015;
Pons et al., 2017). Technological advances have signiﬁcantly
increased our understanding of billﬁsh biology and ecology,
including through the use of electronic satellite tags to reveal
horizontal and vertical movement behaviors (Braun et al., 2015).
Previous satellite tagging studies have primarily focused on
swordﬁsh, sailﬁsh, and marlins, while only a limited amount of
research has been devoted to spearﬁshes (Tetrapturus spp.). Indeed,
over 1000 satellite tags were deployed on billﬁsh globally by 2014,
however only 0.2% were on spearﬁsh species (Braun et al., 2015),
highlighting the need for more research on spearﬁshes.

Among spearﬁshes, Tetrapturus belone is endemic from the
Mediterranean Sea (MED), where it is almost exclusively
distributed (Nakamura, 1985; Collette and Graves, 2019). The
status of this stock has not yet been assessed by ICCAT, due to
the lack of sufﬁcient data, although the species is assessed as Least
Concern in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (Collette et al.,
2023). Information on the distribution patterns and seasonal
movements of T. belone in the MED is still incomplete and data
on the occurrence of this species in the Levantine Basin (Bariche
and Fricke, 2020; Gerovasileiou et al., 2020; Saad et al., 2024) and
western MED (Robins and de Sylva, 1963) are often fragmentary.
However, T. belone is distributed around the Italian peninsula,
primarily found in the Strait of Messina, Tyrrhenian Sea and Strait
of Sicily (Di Natale et al., 2005, 2011; Di Natale, 2012). Furthermore,
many of the ﬁsheries taking T. belone occurred (i.e. driftnets) or are
occurring (i.e. longlines, harpoon, recreational ﬁshing) mostly in
spring, summer or early autumn. This temporal bias may limit our
understanding of the species’ distribution during late autumn and
winter. Additionally, there is a lack of information regarding the
distribution of juvenile individuals.

T. belone is an important ﬁsh resource for some Mediterranean
local markets, in particular in the area of the Strait of Messina where
this species is caught and commercialized by local professional
harpoon ﬁshers (Romeo et al., 2009a, 2015; Malara et al., 2020).
However, catch and landings data are often under-reported
(Collette et al., 2023), thus contributing to the lack of information
on this species. Most data available in the literature comes from
catch series obtained from harpoon (e.g., Di Natale et al., 2005;
Romeo et al., 2015), driftnets (currently banned) and longline
ﬁsheries (Di Natale et al., 2003). According to Collette et al.
(2023),
landings are largely unknown, but they have recently
increased (above 100 t/year), despite only Italy, Spain and

Portugal occasionally and partly providing catch data to ICCAT.
Recently, some fragmentary additional data are also available from
recreational ﬁshing (Collette et al., 2023) and the European Union
Marine Strategy Framework Directive.

According to the available knowledge, the Strait of Messina and
surrounding areas play an important role in different life stages of
the Mediterranean spearﬁsh providing nursery, reproductive and
foraging habitats (Spartà, 1960). Adult T. belone feed primarily on
epipelagic ﬁsh and cephalopods (Romeo et al., 2009a, 2012), but can
also act as a gelatinous plankton opportunistic consumer (Cardona
et al., 2012). The regular presence of T. belone in the Strait of
Messina during late spring and summer (mainly from May to July/
August) is thought to be related to reproduction (Spartà, 1960;
Potoschi, 2000) but may also be associated with food availability
(Robins and de Sylva, 1963).

To date, there is minimal information about the movements,
behavior, ethology, and ecology of T. belone (Robins and de Sylva,
1963; Braun et al., 2015). Only recently, one study investigated the
horizontal and vertical movement behavior of T. belone in the MED
collecting data on one tagged individual (Arostegui et al., 2019a)
while another tagging study failed due to premature death and a
subsequent scavenging event (Malara et al., 2020). Arostegui et al.
(2019a) discovered that, on average, T. belone spent 93% of each 24-
hr period above 30 m and preferred water layers between 26–28°C
but occasionally descended into deeper, colder waters. In addition,
the tagged ﬁsh exhibited a diel vertical migration spending more time
in the near-surface at night and in deeper water layers during the day.
The aim of this paper is to help ﬁll the knowledge gap on T.
belone by investigating the movements and behavior of multiple
individuals of this species in Mediterranean waters via satellite
tagging. Speciﬁcally, we document the seasonal distribution and
assess the depth and thermal preference of T. belone, relating the
behavior to the available environmental data from tag-recorded
parameters and to the diel cycle. These data will be useful as they
increase knowledge on the species’ behavior and can help guide
management decisions.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Study site

Pop-up satellite archival

transmitting (PSAT) X-tags
(Microwave Telemetry, Inc.) were used to perform satellite
tagging on T. belone and deployed in the Strait of Messina, off
north-eastern Sardinia, and off the north-western coast of Sicily
(Figure 1). The weight of each tagged individual was visually
estimated by ﬁshers and researchers.

The Strait of Messina is located in the central Mediterranean
Sea and is the connection point between the Ionian and Tyrrhenian
basins. This area is important because of the strong and turbulent
tidal currents which allow colder, saltier and nutrient-rich deep
Ionian waters to mix with shallower and warmer Tyrrhenian waters
having a different density (Mosetti, 1991). In addition, the Ionian
bottom morphology drives deep water rich in nutrients to the

surface, thanks to upwelling currents, sustaining high levels of
primary production (Spanò and De Domenico, 2017).

Cape San Vito is the western geographic limit of the Gulf of
Castellammare (the widest bay in the northern coast of Sicily with
>70 km of coastline). Here, easterly anticyclonic currents are
responsible for the water circulation inside the Gulf (Istituto
Idrograﬁco della Marina, 1982). The seaﬂoor morphology consists
of a narrow or absent continental shelf above a very steep
continental slope that steps down up to 720 m in the eastern part
and up to 1100 m in the northern (Sulli et al., 2021). In addition,
this area is characterized by submarine canyons (Sulli et al., 2021).
The Sardinia Island is situated between the Sardinia Sea on the
west and Tyrrhenian Sea on the east. The Sardinia Sea is
characterized by the presence of anticyclonic eddies and
upwelling events (Ribotti et al., 2004), whereas, currents are
generated by the action of water masses from the Western
Tyrrhenian sea to the east of the island. The area around Sardinia
Island is highly productive due to wind action from the Strait of
Bonifacio that creates eddies and also mixing of different water
masses from other parts of the MED (i.e. Modiﬁed Atlantic Waters,
Levantine Intermediate Waters, etc.; Olita et al., 2013).

Based on the geographical location, two different ﬁshing and

tagging methods were used:

description and images of these ﬁshing activities see
Battaglia et al., 2018). The tagging operation was
performed using a modiﬁed 3.5 m harpoon pole without
taking the ﬁsh on board. This method was similar to the one
used by Malara et al. (2020), but a compressed rubber
stopper was attached to the application pin to prevent the
pin from penetrating the ﬂesh more than 4 cm. The pole was
also equipped with an action camera (GoPro Hero7) to
record the tagging activity. The tags were applied into the
dorsal musculature near the base of the dorsal ﬁn, behind the
head, using a Domeier anchor dart attachment (Table 1).
2. North-eastern Sardinia and north-western coast of Sicily: the
other tags were deployed using sportﬁshing vessels. The ﬁsh
were caught on rod-and-reel with trolled lures and tagged by
recreational anglers. The maximum duration of ﬁghting was
7 minutes and the handling time was about 3 min. The tags
were applied using a 1.5 m pole equipped with the previously
described compressed rubber stopper. Tags were inserted
into the dorsal musculature near the dorsal ﬁn using a
Domeier anchor dart attachment (Table 1).

2.2 Data collection

1. Strait of Messina: tagging operations were conducted by
researchers on board two professional ﬁshing vessels, which
usually practice traditional swordﬁsh harpoon ﬁshing in this
study area (Romeo et al., 2015; Battaglia et al., 2018).
Individuals were sighted by experienced professional
ﬁshers located on a pulpit at the top of a mast (for a

Tags were programmed for 240-d deployments in which they
recorded temperature, pressure (depth) and light measurements at 2-
min resolution when the tag was in data collection mode. After pop-
off, the tags transmitted summarized versions of stored data via Argos
satellites. Transmitted data resolution was dependent on deployment

duration: resolution of 15 min when deployment duration was <120
days or resolution of 15–30 min when deployment duration was 120–
240 days. Data were logged to onboard memory and summarized
into a time series of depth and temperature.

2.3 Geolocation

Geolocation of the tagged Mediterranean spearﬁsh was
conducted using the HMMoce package for R (Braun et al., 2018).
This gridded hidden Markov model approach compares diverse tag-
based observations against remote sensing and data-assimilating
oceanographic model outputs to generate likelihoods of a tagged
individual’s location and behavior at each time step of its
deployment. At 24-hr intervals, we calculated six separate
likelihoods: (a) bathymetry calculated by excluding areas
shallower than the tag-recorded maximum depth in the
SRTM30_PLUS dataset (Becker et al., 2009),
light-based (b)
latitude and (c) longitude determined by manufacturer post-
processing, (d) sea surface temperature (SST) generated from
comparing tag-based SST values (< 10 m depth) against the
Multi-scale Ultra-high Resolution (MUR) SST dataset (NASA/
JPL, 2015), and a time series of tag-based depth-temperature
proﬁle data (15-s resolution) against the global 1/12o Hybrid
Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM; Bleck, 2002; Chassignet
et al., 2007) in terms of e) integrated ocean heat content (Luo
et al., 2015) and (f) the daily depth-temperature products at the
standard depth levels. The data-assimilating HYCOM reanalysis
product adequately represents real oceanographic processes and
variability in the MED (Wang et al., 2023), justifying the potential
inclusion of depth-temperature likelihoods derived from
likelihood grids were
comparison with this ocean model. All
resampled to 0.08o spatial resolution to match the native
HYCOM grid. Furthermore, all likelihood calculations excluded
any delta-limited temperature and depth measurements, which
are potentially over- or underestimated measurements ﬂagged
by the tag manufacturer’s software because of data compression
limitations onboard the tags. Similarly, the light-based latitude and

longitude likelihood calculations excluded raw light-based estimates
when the raw estimates exceeded the ﬁve-day rolling mean by more
than one degree.

For each ﬁsh, we tested three alternative likelihood
combinations as inputs to the hidden Markov model to determine
which yielded the best geolocation: (1) bathymetry + latitude +
longitude + SST, (2) bathymetry + latitude + longitude + SST +
HYCOM ocean heat content, and (3) bathymetry + latitude +
longitude + SST + HYCOM depth-temperature. The resulting
observation likelihoods were convolved with a diffusive
movement kernel
for a single behavior state. Parameter
estimation of behavior state movement used bound-constrained
optimization (Byrd et al., 1995). Parameter bounds and the initial
value for the movement kernel were informed by the daily
displacement rates (km/d) estimated from previous telemetry
studies of Mediterranean spearﬁsh (Arostegui et al., 2019a) and
white marlin (Kajikia albida; Hoolihan et al., 2015). We used Akaike
information criterion (AIC) weight (Wagenmakers and Farrell,
2004) to identify the best-ﬁt model resulting from the three
different input likelihood combinations we tested. The daily
posterior likelihood surfaces generated by the best-ﬁt models were
summed for each ﬁsh to yield their time-integrated, spatial
utilization distributions (UDs) throughout the overall deployment
and seasonally (Winter: Dec-Feb | Spring: Mar-May | Summer: Jun-
Aug | Fall: Sep-Nov). The most probable track for each deployment
was generated with the Viterbi method, a global decoding solution
that controls path admissibility with the daily posterior likelihoods
to generate realistic movement tracks in areas of complex
topography that is applicable to both demersal (Nielsen et al.,
2023) and pelagic species (Arostegui et al., 2024).

2.4 Seasonal vertical habitat utilization

Seasonal time at depth (TAD) and time at temperature (TAT)
histograms were obtained by the analysis of raw depth and
temperature time series across ﬁsh. using the RchivalTag package
(v. 0.1.2; Bauer, 2018) in Rstudio (Posit team, 2023). While our

Frontiers in Marine Science

analyses focused primarily on the movements of T. belone, we
acknowledge the importance of the well-marked thermocline in the
Mediterranean Sea, which varies in depth and consistency from
mid-spring to mid-autumn.

To address this concern, we calculated the daily thermocline
depth by interpolating temperature and depth at a resolution of 10
meters and then averaging per location (Sicilian Channel,
Tyrrhenian Sea, Ionian Sea, and Aegean Sea) and seasons.
Additionally, for each location, we obtained the tag-based sea
surface temperature (SST) by averaging the seasonal temperature
in the ﬁrst 5 meters of the water column.

In order to assess the preferential depth of T. belone and to relate its
movements to water temperature, we calculated the proportion of time
spent by the tagged individual in each depth (0–10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-
40, 40-50, 50-60, 60-70, 70-80, 80-90, 90-100, >100 m) and
temperature (< 16, 16-18, 18-20, 20–22, 22–24, 24–26, 26–28, 28-30,
>30°C) bin. These proportions were estimated for each 24-hour period
and then averaged to determine the mean TAD and TAT proﬁles.
Additionally, data were further classiﬁed into nautical daytime (dawn
to dusk) and nautical nighttime (dusk to dawn) categories to evaluate
circadian changes in depth and temperature distribution.

To calculate nautical dawn and dusk data for each geolocation
point, geographical coordinates estimated by the tracking model
were utilized, along with the ‘suncalc’ package (v. 0.5.0; Thieurmel
and Elmarhraoui, 2019). To mitigate potential biases related to
anomalous ﬁsh behavior due to the tagging operation or possible
mortality events, data from the deployment and detachment days
were excluded from the analysis.

2.5 Statistical analyses

The distance between deployment and detachment points of the
calculated tracks position, the total distance travelled, and the daily
distance travelled were calculated using the R package “geosphere”
(V. 1.5-14). Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test (Kruskal and Wallis,
1952) followed by Conover-Iman post-hoc test and Bonferroni p-
value adjust (Conover and Iman, 1979; Conover, 1999) were used to
test potential differences in depth or thermal preference, while Two-
sample Wilcoxon test (Bauer, 1972; Hollander et al., 2014) was used
to investigate if there were signiﬁcant diel differences in depth
distribution or thermal preference.

Six individuals of T. belone were tagged ranging between 11 and
20 kg (mean ± SD = 15 ± 2.64 kg; Table 1). All of the deployed tags
transmitted data, covering different periods of the year (summer,
fall and winter), but no ﬁsh had deployment coverage in spring.
Deployment durations ranged from 23 to 210 days (mean ± SD: 115
± 76), for a total of 688 days of observation data from tags. Overall,
150 days (30 ± 7) were recorded in summer, 300 days (75 ± 16) in
fall, and 238 days (79 ± 3) in winter (Table 2). Premature T

detachments of two tags (tag n. 36199 and 36202) were potentially
due to mortality events, whereas in the other cases the tag and
leader apparently detached from the ﬁsh which could be related to a
pull out of the dart or failure at the leader.

3.2 Horizontal movement behavior

Tagged individuals remained within the MED and none of the ﬁsh
went west of Corsica s Sardinia and/or into Adriatic waters (Figure 2).
Generally, ﬁsh movements were restricted to the Tyrrhenian Sea and
central Mediterranean, but in one case (tag n. 36206) the ﬁsh reached
the Aegean Sea before the tag detached. The ﬁsh covered a total
distance of 8492.73 km (1415.46 ± 1028.14 km) with an average speed
of 14.04 ± 7.96 km/day.

Analysis of utilization distribution patterns (Figure 3) revealed a
high importance of the Tyrrhenian basin and Strait of Sicily for
Mediterranean spearﬁsh movements and habitat use. The examined
data showed that the core habitat (5% UD) for Mediterranean

spearﬁsh was mainly concentrated in the Tyrrhenian Sea, where
tagged individuals remained for long periods during their
horizontal movements across all seasons.

In summer, the core habitat occurred in two areas of the
Tyrrhenian Sea: the northern Tyrrhenian as well as between the
Aeolian archipelago and the southern Italian peninsula. The
estimate of core habitat was wider in fall and mainly centered
between Sardinia and Sicily, although the estimate records a small
percentage of core habitat in the Ionian Sea and Strait of Sicily. In
winter, the core habitat was mainly located in three different
Mediterranean areas, i.e. waters off the Aeolian archipelago, Strait
of Sicily off Tunisian coasts and Greek waters in the Aegean Sea.

Home range (<50% UD) habitat of T. belone overlapped with
Tyrrhenian Sea, central Mediterranean basin and the eastern
Mediterranean up to Cyprus. This pattern is also observed during
fall, but considerable seasonal and individual variation in home
range size were observed. For instance, individuals displayed a
reduced home range in summer, expanding only between
northern Tyrrhenian and Libyan coasts. However, the easterly

expansion during the fall and winter was driven by the movement of
a single ﬁsh.

3.3 Vertical movement behavior

The six tagged individuals largely remained in the upper
epipelagic layer above 50 m across all seasons (Figure 4),
spending approximately 99% of time at or above this depth, with
a preference for the ﬁrst 10 m (74.64 ± 14.88%; Figure 5A).
Signiﬁcant differences were found in depth use within all seasons
(KWsummer: df = 10, c2 = 1038.09, P < 2.2e-16; KWfall: df = 10, c2 =
1422.88, P < 2.2e-16; KWwinter: df = 10, c2 = 914.67, P < 2.2e-16),
with T. belone spending a signiﬁcantly greater amount of time in the
ﬁrst 10 m of water (p < 2.2e-16; Figure 5A; Supplementary Table
S1). There were also signiﬁcant differences in diel depth use, mainly
due to higher time spent at 0 – 10 m during the night and 20 – 50 m
during the day (Figure 5A; Supplementary Figure S1A). Below 50 m
there was no diel difference in the time spent at 60 – 70 m and > 90
m (Supplementary Figure S1A). The maximum recorded seasonal
depths were 167.0, 322.8, and 172.1 m in summer, fall and winter,
respectively (Table 3; Figure 6A). Only one individual (n. 36206)

reached depths below 200 m, performing a total of 4 dives into the
mesopelagic zone during fall (Figure 6A; Supplementary Figure S2).
Tagged individuals encountered environmental temperatures
ranging from 14.6 and 30.7°C in summer (mean T = 25.3 ± 1.2°C),
between 15.4 and 29.1°C in fall (mean T = 22.4 ± 1.9°C) and
between 14.9 and 23.6°C in winter (mean T = 17.4 ± 1.7°C) (Table 3;
Figure 6B). More than 85% of time was spent between 24 and 30°C
in summer (Figure 5B), and time spent between 26 and 28°C was
signiﬁcantly higher (34.51% ± 5.99) than other temperature bins
(Supplementary Table S2). Tetrapturus belone spend 78% of the
time between 20 and 26°C in fall. During this season, the time spent
between 20 and 22°C (35.29% ± 22.17) and between 22 and 24°C
(30.96% ± 18.51) were signiﬁcantly higher than the period spent at
other temperatures. In winter, T. belone encountered temperatures
between 16 and 20°C for about 85% of time and the highest
percentage of time (50.06% ± 14.71) was spent between 16 and
18°C.

Differences in the diel pattern of thermal habitat use were also
observed (Figure 5B, Supplementary Figure S1B). During summer,
T. belone spent signiﬁcantly more time between 24 and 28°C at
night and cooler temperature during the day. No statistical
differences were present at temperatures > 28°C (Supplementary

Figure S1B). In fall, temperature 20 – 24°C is occupied mainly
during the night while daytime is restricted between 16 and 20°C
(Supplementary Figure S1B). There were no differences in time
spent during the day/night period at temperature cooler than 16°C
and hotter than 24°C, and no differences in diel temperature use was
found in the winter period (Supplementary Figure S1B).

Our analysis of tagged ﬁsh revealed seasonal variations in Sea
Surface Temperature (SST) across the Mediterranean Sea, as
summarized in Table 4. However, no data were available for the
Aegean Sea and Sicilian Channel in summer, nor during the winter in
the Ionian Sea. Through summer, temperatures ranged between
23.6°C and 28.9°C, with an average SST of 26.4°C ± 1.2°C. The
Ionian Sea exhibited the highest average temperature (27.7°C) among
all regions. In fall, SST ranged from 18.7°C to 27.1°C, with an average
of 23.1°C ± 2.4°C, observed across the Ionian Sea, Sicilian Channel,
and Tyrrhenian Sea. The warmest temperatures were recorded in the
Sicilian Channel (24.4°C), while the lowest were in the Ionian Sea
(21.1°C). In winter, SST decreased across all seas, ranging from
15.2°C to 21.0°C, with an average of 17.2°C ± 1.3°C, and the
Tyrrhenian Sea experiencing the coolest temperatures.

Due to the resolution of the tag data, coupled with the vertical
behavior of the tagged individuals, we were not able to calculate the
thermocline and mixed layer depth reliably, and therefore we did
not include this analysis.

4 Discussion

This research documented the seasonal variability in horizontal
and vertical movements, as well as the thermal and depth
occupation, of six T. belone in the MED using PSAT tags. Our
data supplement and permit inference beyond the information from
the ﬁrst tagging experiment on this species (Arostegui et al., 2019a)
which was restricted to a single individual.

In general, tagged spearﬁsh dispersed from the release locations,
moving to other areas of the Tyrrhenian Sea, Strait of Sicily, Ionian
Sea and, in one case, towards Cypriot and Greek waters, where this
species is considered less common (Akyol, 2020; Gerovasileiou
et al., 2020). None of the tagged ﬁsh visited the western MED
beyond Sardinia or to the Adriatic Sea, although, no data are
available in spring, due to the premature detachment of the tags.
T. belone showed signiﬁcant mobility within the Mediterranean
basin, with a mean straight-line distance from the tag area of 297.01
km, a mean total track distance of 1415.46 km, and mean daily
displacement rate of 14.04 km/day. The only direct comparison
could be done with the T. belone tagged in summer 2015 in the
MED (Arostegui et al., 2019a), which travelled at a matching mean
speed of 14.51 km/day. Similarly high extents of dispersal and
degrees of mobility are known from other billﬁshes such as Kajikia
audax, Istiompax indica and Makaira nigricans in other areas

(Domeier, 2006; Rohner et al., 2020, 2021; Andrzejaczek
et al., 2023).

Despite the variation in movement behavior among individuals,
in most cases, ﬁsh remained within the Tyrrhenian Sea or around
Sicily. Previous research suggests these areas are regularly used by T.
belone as feeding (Romeo et al., 2009a, 2012) and reproductive
grounds (Spartà, 1960; De Sylva, 1975). The spawning period of T.
belone occurs between May and September, with eggs and larvae
found from late spring to summer and juveniles in the fall in the
Strait of Messina (Spartà, 1960). Therefore, our results support the
hypothesis that the Strait of Messina and the surrounding seas are
important areas for the ecology and life-history of T. belone.
Previous studies have also identiﬁed the Strait of Messina and
southern Tyrrhenian Sea as important spawning and/or nursery
grounds for other large pelagic ﬁshes such as swordﬁsh and blueﬁn
tuna (Nishida et al., 1998; Romeo et al., 2009b; Di Natale et al.,
2018). The occurrence of juvenile spearﬁsh as far east in the MED as
the waters of Israel and Lebanon (Nakamura, 1985) and seasonal
inﬂuxes of adult spearﬁsh (some observed in pairs or aggregations
seemingly engaged in courtship and/or spawning) as far west as
Mallorca (Vince Riera, pers. comm.) and the southern coast of
France (Bill François, pers. comm.) suggest the presence of
spawning grounds throughout the basin. Yet, none of the tagged
individuals in this study migrated to these longitudinally distant
locations. Further long-term tagging to be carried out in more areas
of the MED, is needed to elucidate the stock structure and potential
connectivity or regional ﬁdelity of Mediterranean spearﬁsh.
Furthermore, while our study provided evidence of
the
movements of T. belone within the Tyrrhenian Sea, around Sicily
and in one case also in eastern MED, it is important to acknowledge
that the species’ distribution extends beyond these regions.
Additional
literature suggests that T. belone is also present in
various parts of the Mediterranean, including the Adriatic Sea
and the Ligurian Sea (Dulcic and Soldo, 2004; Psomadakis et al.,
2012). Moreover, the species is expected to inhabit the entire
Mediterranean Sea, encompassing areas such as the Strait of
Gibraltar and the near Atlantic region adjacent to the Strait
(Nakamura, 1985; Collette and Graves, 2019). Therefore, future
research efforts should aim to explore the movement patterns and
distribution of T. belone across the broader Mediterranean basin to
its ecology and
obtain a comprehensive understanding of
population dynamics.

Mediterranean spearﬁsh in this study preferred the epipelagic
environment as suggested in a previous study (Arostegui et al.,
2019a), with more than 99% of time spent above 50 m and more
than 70% at 0-10 m. Despite the MED being a temperate basin with
unique oceanography, the epipelagic behavior was also observed in

night and daylight were observed, with the tendency to occupy
deeper depths during the day than night. This was also observed in
other billﬁshes such as T. pﬂuegeri (Kerstetter et al., 2009), M.
nigricans (Andrzejaczek et al., 2023), Kajikia albida (Vaudo et al.,
2017), and Istiophorus platypterus (Pohlot and Ehrhardt, 2017) but
the reverse of the pattern characteristic of T. angustirostris
(Arostegui et al., 2019b, 2024). Furthermore, recent study by
Arostegui et al. (2019a) reported a maximum depth of 84 m
reached by an individual equipped with a PSAT tag, while
Nakamura (1985) supposed a vertical distribution not exceeding
200 m. However, we observed for the ﬁrst time that this species is
also able to perform deep excursions into mesopelagic waters, with
recorded dives below 200 m and a maximum depth of 322.8 m.

Diving into the mesopelagic zone below 200 m may serve
various ecological functions (e.g. predator avoidance, feeding
activity; Braun et al., 2022) and has been observed in other
billﬁsh species (i.e., M. nigricans, I. indica, K. audax; Rohner
et al., 2022; Andrzejaczek et al., 2023). We found that the depth
range of T. belone extended to greater depths during fall and winter,
reaching depths > 200 m. This behavior is likely due to the changes
in the seasonal thermocline during fall and winter (Houpert et al.,
2015). The seasonal variations in the depth of the mixed layer
within the Mediterranean Sea signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the vertical
distribution of thermoclines, subsequently affecting the spatial
distribution of prey species (Sabatés et al., 2009). Mediterranean
spearﬁsh, similar to other billﬁshes, are likely to modulate their

vertical movements in response to these ﬂuctuations (Braun et al.,
2015), aiming to optimize feeding opportunities within the portion
of the water column that is accessible to this species based on its
thermal physiology (Arostegui et al., 2019a). These ﬂuctuations in
the MED mixed layer depth play a pivotal role in shaping the
thermal structure of the water column, thereby potentially
inﬂuencing the behavior and depth preferences of apex predators
as documented elsewhere (Block et al., 2001). While we could not
retrieve the thermocline depth and or mixed layers information
from our tagging data, we were able to obtain sea surface
temperature of the water column < 5m. Sea surface temperature
is vital for inﬂuencing the mixing layer and thermocline depth
(Houpert et al., 2015), and it is crucial during spawning seasons,
enabling animals to spawn when the water temperature is optimal
(Boyce et al., 2008). Indeed, environmental temperature affects
metabolic rate (Fry, 1947; Clarke and Johnston, 1999) which,
inﬂuences billﬁsh distribution and
among other parameters,
behavior (e.g., Dale et al., 2022).

During winter months in the MED, heightened wind activity
and cooler temperatures lead to increased mixing of the water
column and the formation of deeper mixed layers (Heslop et al.,
2012). Similarly, our tags recorded SST in winter exhibited a
signiﬁcant region-speciﬁc temperature decrease (Table 4). The
coolest temperatures were recorded in the Tyrrhenian Sea,
followed by the Sicilian Channel and the Aegean Sea. These
cooler temperatures are characteristic of winter conditions and
are potentially inﬂuenced by seasonal currents or regional
weather patterns (Zveryaev, 2015). Conversely, in the summer
months, the MED experiences shallower mixed layers due to
warmer temperatures and reduced wind activity (Heslop et al.,
2012). Tag-based SST reached its peak, with the Ionian Sea
recording the highest average temperature, likely due to exposure
to solar radiation contributing to its warmer temperatures. The
Tyrrhenian Sea, although slightly cooler than the Ionian Sea, still
maintained warm temperatures conducive to ﬁsh activity (Table 4).
In response,
large pelagic organisms may seasonally shift the
distribution of their vertical movements to continually exploit
prey associated with this thermal gradient, promoting increased
metabolic rates and feeding activity among ﬁsh populations. In the
fall, the Mediterranean Sea experiences changes in water
thermocline and mixing, affecting large pelagic animals. Cooling
temperatures and shifting wind patterns lead to a shallowing of the
thermocline and increased water column mixing (Houpert et al.,
2015). SST exhibited notable variation across different regions. The
Aegean Sea and Tyrrhenian Sea recorded moderate temperatures,
while the Ionian Sea experienced slightly cooler conditions. On the
contrary, the Sicilian Channel exhibited signiﬁcantly warmer
likely inﬂuenced by local environmental factors.
temperatures,
These changes can inﬂuence spawning behaviors, migration
patterns, and foraging strategies of large pelagic animals as they
adapt to shifting environmental conditions in pursuit of prey and
suitable spawning grounds.

The sea surface temperatures discussed here closely align with
the mean seasonal SST observed in the MED across all regions
(Skliris et al., 2011; Shaltout and Omstedt, 2014; Zveryaev, 2015;
Garcı́a-Monteiro et al., 2022). The rising sea surface temperatures in

the Mediterranean Sea signiﬁcantly impact marine ecosystems
(Calvo et al., 2011; Lange, 2020), affecting billﬁsh populations
(Dell’Apa et al., 2018). Satellite data conﬁrms this rise (Calvo
et al., 2011; Lange, 2020), potentially altering billﬁsh distribution,
behavior, and health (Alix et al., 2020). This could lead to shifts in
habitat range and migratory patterns (Alix et al., 2020).
Additionally, higher sea temperatures may decrease billﬁsh
growth rates, reproductive success, and increase susceptibility to
diseases (Alix et al., 2020). Understanding these impacts is crucial
for conserving marine ecosystems, especially for apex predators.

The results of this paper improve the current understanding of
the ecology, migratory behavior, and habitat preference of T. belone,
as well as help in identifying crucial knowledge gaps that might help
understand the distribution of the species within its range of
occurrence. In particular, to better understand the migratory
patterns of this species it is necessary to increase the tagging
efforts, expanding to a broader range of the Mediterranean. In
concert with approaches from other disciplines, such as genetics,
additional tagging data would help resolve whether there is a single
panmictic stock or multiple differentiated stocks within the basin,
which is paramount to ensuring appropriate management strategies
for this ﬁsh resource. Furthermore, additional research must also be
conducted to collect yearly/seasonal catch data (landings by
country, season, size composition) as well as life history
information that are key factors for future stock assessments of
this ﬁshery resource.
