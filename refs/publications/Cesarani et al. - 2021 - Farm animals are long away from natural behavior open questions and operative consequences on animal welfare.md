Simple Summary: Animal welfare is a very important issue. One of the tasks of researchers is
to provide explanations and possible solutions to questions arising from non-experts. This work
analyzes part of the extensive literature on relationships between selection and domestic, mainly
farm, animals’ behavior and deals with some very important themes, such as the role of regulations,
domestication, and selection.

Abstract: The concept of welfare applied to farm animals has undergone a remarkable evolution. The
growing awareness of citizens pushes farmers to guarantee the highest possible level of welfare to
their animals. New perspectives could be opened for animal welfare reasoning around the concept of
domestic, especially farm, animals as partial human artifacts. Therefore, it is important to understand
how much a particular behavior of a farm animal is far from the natural one of its ancestors. This
paper is a contribution to better understand the role of genetics of the farm animals on their behavior.
This means that the naïve approach to animal welfare regarding returning animals to their natural
state should be challenged and that welfare assessment should be considered.

Keywords: bioethics; domestication; genetic selection; animal behavior; animal welfare

1. Introduction

Ethics in animal production is a hot topic and a huge amount of literature has been
published [1]. One of the most debated topics in the past few decades, both at scholarly
and public opinion levels, is the question of whether animals farming would be considered
morally justiﬁed. A recent multisectoral contribution on ethics in animal-sourced food
has been published in a monographic issue of Animal Frontiers [2]. Vegetarian and vegan
movements are deboarding from their original nutritional ideological beliefs to broadly
embrace the animalist party point of view, claiming that animal products, mainly meat,
must be banned in human diets [3]. At the heart of the recent public debate on human–
animal relationships, there is the growing awareness of citizens that the use of animals for
human purposes must include the obligation on the part of farmers to guarantee them a
high level of welfare [4].

It is worthy to note that the word “welfare” may assume different meanings depend-
ing on the context; the main two refer to a “physical and mental health and happiness,
especially of a person” and “to help given, especially by the state or an organization, to
people who need it, especially because they do not have enough money” [5]. Under an
operational point of view, as needed for scientiﬁc purposes, the concept of welfare applied
to farm animals has undergone a remarkable evolution until it reached a formulation
that includes the following fourfold aspect: (a) biological and technical deﬁnitions, that
emphasize the basic needs of animals and the freedom that should be given and the possi-
bility of coping with environmental challenge; (b) regulation approaches, according which
animals are sensitive creatures so they must be reared in the environment compatible
to the biological needs of the species. This leads to the translation of the concept into a

legal framework; (c) philosophical approach, discussing the role of animals in the humans’
societies; (d) interactive approach, that considers communication between farmers and
animals and its impact on livestock systems [6].

Among biological approaches, neurocognitive studies have begun to achieve impor-
tant results since Charles Darwin [7], and his student Georges Romanes [8], proposed
that human mental states represent a continuum with animal ones deriving from them by
evolution. Later, several scholars criticized this point of view, arguing that the animals’
traits that can be found in humans, and not the other way around. However, Darwin
himself was conscious that arguing “the existence of human traits in animals rather than
animal traits in human beings allowed him to express his point of view on animal and
human continuity in a more acceptable way for contemporary society in which, as Eliz-
abeth Knoll [9] observed, feelings anthropomorphic were popular in the upper middle
classes” [10]. Over a century of comparative neurocognitive studies in animals and humans,
which summarization is quite difﬁcult and overtake the scope of this contribution, have
led the scientiﬁc communities to converge on the belief that higher animals (and here the
controversy moves to the border that demarcates this category) are endowed with mental
states such as to generate internal representations of the external world. This entailed the
normative evolution that established for animals a state of sentient organisms (e.g., EU
Lisbon Treaty, 2007) [11], that can express basic sensations such as fear, pain and pleasure.
Thus, several laws were issued to protect and safeguard their well-being. However, neu-
rocognitive scientists have established that animals raised for economic purposes (e.g.,
milk and meat production) show differences in cognitive abilities and brain lateralization
that can affect adaptive behavioral, physiological, and immune responses to environmental
stressors [12]. However, evidence of advanced cognition in animals says little about their
sentience (i.e., feeling) [13] and the lack of direct proofs, acquired only through verbal
abilities, advise to consider alternative hypotheses before attributing conscious states that
can account for animal behavior [10]. On the other hands, at the begin of this century a
behaviorist line of thinking emerged; this new point of view has based the evaluation of
animal welfare on the “emotions” of farmed livestock [14], opening a controversial ﬁeld of
discussion between animal sensations, feelings and emotions [15].

The classic research of Belyaev [16] and his students on silver foxes have shown that
the domestication process, including in the speciﬁc case the selection of the animals that
presented less fear of man, affects not only the morphological characters of the animals, but
also (and especially) the behavioral ones. Recently, Kukakova et al. [17] have sequenced
and assembled the genomes of the fox of Belyaev experiment and re-sequenced a subset
of foxes from the tame, aggressive and conventional farm-bred populations to identify
genomic regions associated with the response to selection for behavior: they found 103
regions with either signiﬁcantly decreased heterozygosity in one of the three populations or
increased divergence between the populations, demonstrating the genetic based behavior
in domestic animals.

Therefore, news perspectives could be opened for animal welfare reasoning around
the concept of domestic, especially farm, animals as partial human artifacts (in this review
we assume for human artifact or construct the meaning of what, in this case animal,
modiﬁed by human for his own purposes). Therefore, it is important to understand how
much behaviors of farm animals are far away from the natural ones of their ancestors.
The consequences bring directly to assume a mixed natural and anthropocentric point of
view when we discuss about farm animal welfare. A pioneering work aimed at founding
a theory of the effects of domestication on animal behavior was carried out by Price [18]
who, on the basis of the already abundant literature available at that time, analyzed the
factors that mainly inﬂuenced the changes in their character.

This review analyses the effects of domestication and artiﬁcial selection on animal
behavioral traits coupled with morphological ones. A wide literature has been considered
to contribute to better understand the role of genetics of the farm animals on their behavior,
ﬁnalized to demonstrate that as they are partially human artifacts, and so that their welfare

Animals 2021, 11, 724

should be assessed taking into account the artiﬁcial environment where farm animals have
been selected. Scopus® database was ﬁrstly scanned by using “bioethics, animal behavior,
behavioral heritability, animal selection and behavior” as keywords; furthermore, general
literature on animal ethics and animal welfare was taken into account. Results coming
from the analyzed literature were extracted, classiﬁed and discussed, to derive our original
points of view.

The hypothesis we want to demonstrate in this review is that the naive approach
to animal welfare that brings it back to a natural state is not completely right and that
welfare assessments must necessarily consider that the behaviors of farm animals have
been partially, but consistently, constructed by humans.

2. Domestication Changed Animal Traits

Domestication is a lively area of scientiﬁc research in which no consensus has been
reached on its meaning yet. For our purpose we adopted the Zeder co-evolutive point of
view [19]: she deﬁnes domestication as “a sustained multigenerational, mutual relationship
in which one organism assumes a signiﬁcant degree of inﬂuence over the reproduction
and care of another organism in order to secure a more predictable supply of a resource of
interest, and through which the partner organism gains advantage over individuals that
remain outside this relationship, thereby beneﬁtting and often increasing the ﬁtness of both
the domesticator and the target domesticate”. Under this framework, Zeder [19] observed
that human domestications are different from non-human ones because we have been able
to opportunistically grasp and modify the traits that have increased the beneﬁts obtained
from co-evolutionary relationships with the target species. Moreover, we have transmitted
these practices capable of achieving our goals not only within the parental circle, but also
to all through social learning. Animal domestication is a cultural issue of Homo sapiens
because, until now, no trace of similar practices has been found by archaeologists for the
most ancient Hominidae species, even though they have been in continuous contact, as
hunters, with wild animals for millions of years.

Restricting this ﬁeld to livestock, when humans became sedentary farmers, they
started to domesticate wild animals to ﬁt different needs, such as work, and meat or
wool production. This can be considered at all the ﬁrst step of the artiﬁcial selection
processes. However, during this long time of human–animal partnership, natural selection
has continued to shape the domestic animals but, as Darwin [20] ﬁrstly observed, these
factors have been overwhelmed by the artiﬁcial ones. For this reason, in this review we
have considered the effects of human selection only. Beside historical and archeological
traces, modern genomics tools allowed to study and deﬁne a timeline of the domestication
process [21–23]. The domestication of livestock species started in Southwest Asia (the
Near East) about 10,000 years ago with goats, sheep, humpless cattle, pigs and then water
buffalo, horse, chicken and, more recently, rabbit [24–26]. Horses were domesticated for
their key role in warfare and transportation during multiple events somewhere in the
Eurasian plains [27]. An interesting case is the rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) which is a
key species (is the only relevant mammal livestock species originating from Europe at the
Roman empire age) because of its role as livestock, game, pet, and experimental animal (as
well as pest in several countries, mainly Australia) [28,29].

Domestication process changes phenotypic and behavioral characteristics of wild ani-
mals depending on the species. Behavioral and morphological traits of modern livestock
breeds resulted from artiﬁcial selection of natural useful characters: in fact, domestication
process increased the phenotypic and genetic variability of breeds and the modern bio-
diversity is one the most important outcomes of the domestication before and selection
later. Under this point of view, the domestication created prototypes of each species that
were subsequently shaped by the artiﬁcial selection process leading to an increase in the
variability, in terms of both genetic and phenotypic richness. Rasali et al. [30] reported that
humans all around the world raise about 200 and 400 pure and composite sheep breeds,
respectively. Even if the exact knowledge about the sheep descendant is still debated, all

Animals 2021, 11, 724

these breeds, characterized by different morphological traits and ability to adapt to ex-
tremely different environments, seem to be originated from just a couple of wild ancestors.
Let us think also to bovine (Bos taurus) and zebuine (Bos taurus indicus) breeds that, even
showing important differences between and within them, share the same wild ancestor, the
aurochs (Bos primigenius): starting from this, more than 1000 cattle breeds are nowadays
raised worldwide [31]. Of particular interest is also the pig of which 566 different breeds
can be enumerated, all originating from the wild boar [32]. Domesticated sheep and goats
show different features compare to their wild ancestors, such as reduced body size and
horn length [23,33]. Domesticated cattle breeds show smaller size compared to the extinct
wild aurochs and they developed the capacity to adapt to various environments [34–36].
However, some cattle breeds have longer horns with particular shape that were selected
for religious reasons [27]. Another interesting phenotype shaped during domestication
process is the coat color, that in some species (such as horse, cattle and sheep) is a useful
trait to discriminate among breeds.

Domestication changed, not only external features, but also behavior and aptitude of
livestock species [18,37]. For example, sheep and goats were chosen for their meekness
and for their multiple productions (e.g., meat, milk, wool and horns). However, the
mechanisms behind this process were not still completely clear, and different theories have
been proposed during time, until second half of the twentieth century, when the modern
concept of ethology raised [38]. The behavioralists of the past believed that changes in
animals’ behavior were mainly due to the different environments, learning and nurture.
Nowadays, this concept has been abandoned in favor of a more realistic one involving
a genetic determinism [39–41]. This is particularly true because a trait without heritable
mechanisms could not play a role in the evolution process. Other authors proposed a
theory, in which neural crest cells play a key role, called “domestication syndrome” to put
together all the differences in phenotypic, and therefore genetic, characteristic between wild
and domesticated species [42,43]. The term domestication syndrome applied to animals
came from the domesticated crop plants [44]. As speciﬁed by Sánchez-Villagra et al. [45],
the word “syndrome” is not related to a particular pathological condition or disease, but it
came from the literature about plants that humans selected for interrelated syndromes of
characteristics during the domestication process [46]. Sánchez-Villagra et al. [45] reported
that some modiﬁcations are common to almost all domesticated animal species: increased
docility, increased skillfulness in using human cues, increased fecundity, reduction of tooth,
brain and rostrum size, ﬂoppiness of the ears, curliness of the tail and depigmentation of
skin and fur. Two main hypotheses were suggested for explaining the differences between
wild and domesticated species: the ﬁrst one state that these differences are due to the
new environment in which domesticated animals received improved diets and found
better live conditions. The second one suggested that domestication syndrome was related
to hybridization between different breeds or even species. Anyway, livestock species
undergone domestication syndrome show differences in morphological and behavioral
traits compared to their presumed wild ancestors. (Table 1).

Regarding the changes in animals’ behavior, all features of farm animals that are
currently raised by humans show heritable genetic variations [47,48]. Fear and interactions
with humans, sexual maturity and social behavior were also affected by domestication.
Farm animals show less fear of humans, and they are more inclined to cooperate with
humans with a lower stress level. Farmed pigs reach sexual maturity at about 6–7 months,
whereas for wild boars, sexual maturity is reached at approximately two years [49]. More-
over, farm animals are forced to live in larger groups, compared to their wild ancestor,
under crowded conditions [48]. York [50] reported a list of the behavioral traits, and the
tests used to study them, that have been analyzed in livestock species.

Genomic studies allowed to trace the domestication process and to highlight genomic
regions where genes involved in the phenotypic differences among breeds are mapped.
For example, Cesarani et al. [51] compared two related sheep breeds, one showing an-
cestral traits and one selected for milk aptitude, and they found signiﬁcant genomic
regions that harbor gene involved in morphological traits such as coat color (MC1R, MITF),
horned/polled (RXFP2) and body size (NPY, VIP). Moreover, the authors identiﬁed the
HOXB1 gene that was already associated with the anotia phenotype in mice [52], that is
of interest because the breed with ancestral traits is characterized by microtia, external
malformation trait that is often present in wild animals [53,54]. Hornedness/polledness is
one of the main traits modiﬁed by human selection during the domestication from wild
ancestor to modern breeds [55]: e.g., ancestral wild sheep showed big horns useful as
defense and injury instrument.

Several studies focused their attention to the different genetic background (e.g., dif-
ferent gene expression) between wild and domesticated animals [56,57]. One of the ideas
is that these differences are not related to different environment and methods of farming,
but they are heritable traits that can be transmitted to the progeny [58–60]. This theory
seems to be in contrast with the ﬁrst one of Charles Darwin [20] in which the theory of
heredity was absent. Domestication is one of the most important events in mankind’s
history, which has now consequences that are intrinsic in the everyday reality. Recently,
some studies highlighted that species undergone domestication for thousands of years,
showed changes in behavior, color, morphology and physiology which are related to sev-
eral independent genomic regions [61,62]. However, studies on species with more recent
domesticated history (e.g., cat and salmon) revealed fewer signals [63,64] compared to
the older domesticated species. Thus, these changes could be associated with the exten-
sion of the domestication process. This hypothesis is strengthened by the fact that a long
time is needed to ﬁx the heritable traits, especially those with lower heritability; even
under strong selection pressure, only small changes in gene frequencies can be observed
over several generations [65]. On the contrary, recent investigations demonstrated that
sometimes only few [66] or exceptionally just one [67] generations could be enough to
show genetic adaptation to captivity. In order to test this idea, Christie et al. [60] analyzed
gene expression between the offspring of ﬁrst-generation hatchery trout and wild trout
reared in an identical environment. The authors found 723 genes differently expressed
in the two groups of animals, mostly involved in responses in wound healing, immunity
and metabolism.

As aforementioned, the genomic studies were able to identify selection signatures,
i.e., genome regions shaped by selection, that can differentiate wild and domesticated
animals. In these regions, genes encoding for the phenotypic differences were mapped.
Due to involvement of genes and the fact that progenies of wild and domesticated animals
show feature like their ancestor and not to the opposite group, genomic mechanisms of the
domestication, and therefore its heritable pathway, could be conﬁrmed.

3. Questions and Answers about Modern Farm Animals

Domestication, ﬁrstly, and genetic selection subsequently, are shown to be effective
tools to change the temperament of farm animals orienting it towards the desired behav-
ioral characteristics (e.g., docility, resistance to adversity, patience, maternal attitude . . . ).
Current characters of farm animals were demonstrated to be a human construct, and that
they can be further quite rapidly oriented by their insertion among the breeding goals of
genetic selection. Nowadays, we are faced with several ethical questions, and subsequently
approaches to assess and improve animal welfare.

Ethic is a philosophical rich ﬁeld that explores the unknown answer by dealing
originally with known arguments. According to Floridi [68], philosophers usually ask
open questions to which they usually do not provide deﬁnitive answers. However, they
tend to deﬁne the problem space and within it they try to give the most probable answer
according to the state of knowledge. Under the recent constructivism point of view, the
philosopher is a model builder who reduces the problem space at the minimum manageable
to further connect these elements in a most complex and complete framework. In this
way, the scientist is a special type of philosopher who deals exclusively with real facts
instead of abstract entities, for which however he seeks an answer based on experience and
continually revisable according to the evidence of new elements [69].

Question one: Does the character change in domesticated animals by human purposes

shifted some of the responsibility for their survival and well-being into human actions?

As domestication is a particular case of coevolution between living organisms, the
pervasiveness of humans should modify the environment and consequently the factors
inﬂuencing the behavior in wild animals also. In fact, animals living near humans (e.g.,
in contexts like captivity and urbanization) rapidly change their antipredator behavior
and become tolerant to people’s presence [70]. This justiﬁes the growing awareness to
take care for wild animals (e.g., care in wildlife centers in case of disease, foraging in
case of food scarcity, etc.), even if this can divert their evolutionary trajectory because
of the manipulation of the natural ﬁtness factors. While it is generally accepted that
humans are responsible for the welfare of wild animals by manipulating part of the natural
environmental factors to protect them, the share of human responsibility on the welfare of
farm animals is greater due to the fact that some behaviors have changed due to artiﬁcial
selection. This means that the breeders, when designing their welfare programs, must
consider the distance that exists between the behavioral construct of the animals they
reared and that of the natural environment, paying greater attention to the needs of the
animals, the greater this distance. In other words, high productivity animals kept in
more intensive farming systems have a greater need for attention to their welfare than
less productive ones reared in extensive systems. Just a few examples are the superior
care associated with intensive systems, such as higher veterinary care, control of the
production environment in terms of temperature, humidity and light, and better feeding
and managements strategies [71]. Another example is represented by the use of piglet
lamps in the sow farrowing pens compared to body heat of the mother in extensive pig
systems [72]. It follows that animal welfare is a technology that, like the others used for
animal breeding, must be studied and applied not only for ethical purposes, but also to
obtain the best coupling between available environmental conditions and animal health
and productivity.

Question two: Can the behavior be indicated as genetic goal in animal selection? The
starting point of this answer must necessarily rest on the principle, initially elaborated
by Rollin [73] and subsequently perfected by Shriver [74], of the conservation of welfare
in animals subjected to genetic manipulation: “any animals that are genetically modiﬁed
through the use of genetic technology [for our intent, this means both by classical genetic
selection of genetic manipulation], for purposes other than research, should be no worse off,
in terms of suffering, than the parent stock was prior to genetic alterations.” Several genetic
studies demonstrated that behavioral traits are inheritable: estimates mostly range from
10 to 50% [47,50,75–77]. The interest in estimate heritability of behavioral traits of farm

Animals 2021, 11, 724

7 of 14

livestock lies in the past: Kjaer and Sørensen [78] estimated the heritabilities of cannibalism
and feather pecking in laying hens of White Leghorn breed. In fact, restricted and crowded
spaces bring the hens to attack other animals or even injury themselves and farmers try to
prevent these behaviors through beak trimming, practice under scrutiny by animals’ right
associations [79]. Due to these heritable mechanisms, behavioral traits can become (and
sometimes are already) the goal of breeding scheme.

As aforementioned, also behavior was shaped by the domestication process and there-
fore genetic studies analyzed also this range of traits. For example, Ding et al. [80] found
a single intronic retroelement involved with variations in courtship dance in Drosophila
species. York [50] analyzed more than one thousand genomic loci (of mammals, birds, ﬁsh,
insects and nematodes) associated with a series of behavioral traits (such as: courtship,
feeding, aggression, motor, emotion, temperament, learning, social, parental and circa-
dian) and he conﬁrmed the genetic determinism of such traits. This author reported that
courtship and feeding behaviors are determined by genomic regions of signiﬁcantly greater
effect than other traits. Boissy et al. [81] analyzed the effect of genotypes (i.e., different
breed composition) of both lamb and dams on the emotional reactivity in sheep. These
authors concluded that most of the differences were due to direct additive genetic effects
and that females were more active and avoided more the human contact compared to
male lambs.

Reduce the aggressivity of animals would have a series of positive beneﬁts both for
animals and humans. Let us focus on pigs and on the positive beneﬁts in this species.
Turner et al. [82] investigated the genetic aspects of individual aggressiveness in pigs by the
association of skin lesions and behavioral traits. Animals living in crowded situations tend
to be more aggressive, even if aggressivity to get access to resources can be also found in
nature (for example regrouping at pasture) to deﬁne a new social order [83,84]; in pigs there
are both reciprocal and non-reciprocated aggressions. In both cases, animals suffering these
assaults are more stressed, reduce their feed intake and therefore their productions. One of
the main problems related to behavior in pigs is the aggressive behavior of sows towards
their piglets: this problem has also been largely studied since the past. Already in the late
twentieth century, Knap and Merks [85] analyzed the aggressiveness of primiparous sows
and reported a decrease of litter size at weaning of almost two piglets per litter. These
authors reported heritabilities ranging between 0.40 and 0.90. These numbers show the
effectiveness of including the mildness among the breeding goals: through genetic (or
now genomic) selection, the aggressiveness of livestock animals can be reduced by having
positive effects in terms of animal welfare and production.

Another behavioral trait is the ﬁghting aptitude in South America and European cattle
breeds [86]. One example is the Spanish ﬁghting bull (known also as Iberian or Lidia bulls)
which is raised in Spain, Portugal, France and South American countries (e.g., Mexico) for
bull ﬁghting events [87,88]. Another example are the not cruel traditional events of ﬁghting
among cows belonging to Aosta Chestnut and Aosta Black Pied [89] or Valdostana [90–92]
cattle breeds in North Italy (Alpine regions). Both tourism and farmers take important
economic advantages from this kind of contest, named “battle of queens”. At the end of
October, pregnant cows are divided in classes according to their size and they ﬁght (by
pushing forward the other animal using their weights) without injuring the opponents.
The cow winning this tournament becomes the “queen of all queens” and it assures huge
incomes to its farmer, who can sell her or her offspring. Fighting aptitude is evaluated and
breeding values are estimated for Valdostana Pezzata Nera and Castana cattle breeds; this
behavioral trait is already included in the breeding schemes of these breeds.

Further important “behavioral” traits shifted by selection are adaptation and re-
silience [93]. The animal production is now become more efﬁcient and, therefore, each unit
of production shows a smaller environmental footprint [94]. Moreover, animals are not
only more efﬁcient, but they adapted to produce in very different environments. How-
ever, areas of production are likely going to become harsher (e.g., increased heat, disease
challenges) [93]. Thus, if we consider the heat-tolerance among the “behavioral” traits,

Animals 2021, 11, 724

adaptability to difﬁcult environments is (and will be) a strategic point. Resilience is mostly
deﬁned as the capacity to recover quickly from difﬁculties. Unfortunately, it seems at
resilience is negatively correlated with genetic selection pointing to increase production
traits, which reduced environmental adaptation [93]. Frankham [95] stated that genetic
selection for the adaptation to captivity reduced ﬁtness, which is conﬁrmed when animals
are reintroduced into the wild. Thus, selection for resilience will largely acts on morbidity,
longevity and mortality rather than productive performance. Resilient animals may show
lower performances in optimal environments [93].

It is interesting to note that the more recent domestication of rabbits has made it
possible to retain many of the ancestral and wild behaviors, like living in small groups of
2–8 individuals with familiar subgroups, spend the time mainly underground and coming
outside only for foraging, stand up to check for any predators, locate a speciﬁc area for
the true feces (scrapes), etc. When these animals are placed in free-range conditions, they
make nests and dig burrows [96].

Finally, two other species in which behavior has a large impact are dogs [97,98], and
horses [99,100]. It is worthy to mention these species because of their tight relationship with
humans: dogs and horses are raised as companion (both), working (mainly dogs) or sport
(mainly horses) animals. Thus, it is compulsory that these animals show low aggressivity
towards humans. Years of selection of candidates based not only on performances, but
also on conduct, led to animals with tame behavior particularly suitable for staying with
children or disabled: just think of dogs for blind people or horses for therapeutic riding.
Without selection for behavioral traits, these animals improving the life quality of humans
there would not have been.

Question three: How can farmers achieve the highest possible welfare for their an-
imals? The sustainable intensiﬁcation of livestock chains is the narrow way to simulta-
neously meet the growing demand for food of animal origin and the reduction of their
environmental and social impacts [101]. The economic pressure to reduce costs for main-
taining the viability of farming enterprises and the scaling order that assigns more animals
per operator, have diverted the perspective in the design and construction of farming
environments towards savings and removed the animals from the direct control of the
farmers. Furthermore, the need for manpower on farms with the increasing insert of
employees of non-rural extraction or coming from work paths other than breeding, has led
to the drop in tension for animal welfare based on life experience or on work or training
courses adequate to the ethical challenge in game. Finally, over a century of selection based
on functional traits has placed character traits in the background, with the consequence
that technologies have to chase the well-being of current animals as their behavior has not
been subject to selection as had happened since the dawn of domestication.

To address sustainable animal welfare—where the word “sustainable” means a reliable
and enduring set of knowledge developed on ethical and economic assumptions applied
to livestock farming—the environment (physical and physio-phycological) where the
animals will spend their lives must be designed and built with primary welfare in mind
reachable by the real subjects (i.e., by the concrete individuals that will inhabit the precise
temporal-physical space). Precision livestock farming (PLF), one of the information and
communication technologies (ICT) often installed at farm level with no consistency and
underutilized by farmers, needs to be designed and geared consistently to reduce stressors
and to monitor on an individual level each animal, replacing the eyes and expertise once
owned by the breeders.

An attempt to adapt breeding environments to the high performances of current
animals is those pursued by the Ethical Barn®, a new way to treat and stay dairy cows
in balance between social sustainability (farmer’s income), environmental sustainability
and respect for the right of the cow, aiming to give a decent life to cows [102]. This holistic
approach allows to manage dairy cows with very high production performances—as the

top dairy farms—while minimizing physical and mental stress, sources of infection and
environment impact.

Unlike ruminants, in which the extra-resting circadian time budget is mainly spent on
feeding-rumination-milking/suckling activities, in monogastric the conditions of captive
breeding involve large time spaces that must be ﬁlled to avoid alienation phenomena and
consequent psychological discomforts. In pigs, environmental enrichment is a rapidly
developing technique, also supported by regulatory obligations within the EU [103], but
which faces many obstacles globally to be applied correctly [104].

The Info-Farming revolution is under our eyes, supported by the evolution of the
PLF, which allows the rapid diffusion of sensor devices with greater process data capacity
at lower costs and pervasive ITC, which have become a prevalent part of our life today.
In this last aspect, the spread of smartphones capable of collecting real-life snapshots
and delivering them to the social media circuit in real time represents a challenge to the
adoption of correct animal welfare procedures on farms. At the same time, the creation of
social communities among breeders makes possible to exchange technical information and
to share welfare procedures capable of rapidly improving the living conditions of animals
raised on their farms.

One of the most important aspects is to bring the animals closer to the breeder,
especially when large numbers of animals and large breeding facilities prevent real control
of the animal welfare conditions [105]. As pointed out by Neethirajan [106], artiﬁcial
intelligence (AI) can represent the next step to reach the better animal outcomes, processing
and making strategic decisions to improve the welfare and health of farmed animals.

Summarizing, the profound changes in animal genetic and breeding environments
mean that farmers are increasingly committed to livestock welfare. This goal can be
achieved both with an adequate genetic improvement, which also has as its goal the be-
havioral characteristics associated with the well-being of animals in modern breeding
conditions (genetics for environmental adaptation), and with the massive use of PLF
technologies capable to meet the growing needs of increasingly performing animals (envi-
ronment for high-producing animals) (Figure 1).

4. Practical Implications

Current farm animals are the result of millennia of selection which has led to their
departure from the physiology and behavior of their ancestors. Cows that produce 12,000 L
of milk, steers that grow by 2 kg per day, sows that give birth to 30 piglets per year and
hens that lay 280 eggs per year are phenotypes very far from the performance of their wild
ancestors (e.g., 1000 L of milk per year per cow, 0.3 kg/d of body weight increase in steers,

This holistic approach allows to manage dairy cows with very high production performances—as the 20 tons/head of milk per lactation indicated as phenotypic to achieve in 10 years by the top dairy farms—while minimizing physical and mental stress, sources of infection and environment impact.  Unlike ruminants, in which the extra-resting circadian time budget is mainly spent on feeding-rumination-milking/suckling activities, in monogastric the conditions of cap-tive breeding involve large time spaces that must be filled to avoid alienation phenomena and consequent psychological discomforts. In pigs, environmental enrichment is a rapidly developing technique, also supported by regulatory obligations within the EU [103], but which faces many obstacles globally to be applied correctly [104]. The Info-Farming revolution is under our eyes, supported by the evolution of the PLF, which allows the rapid diffusion of sensor devices with greater process data capacity at lower costs and pervasive ITC, which have become a prevalent part of our life today.

8 piglets/year per sow and 20–25 eggs per year per hen) which were commensurate with
the turnover rate of the natural population in balance with its environment. The one to
two order of magnitude of biological surplus produced by the modern livestock, used for
human food interests, places these animals under great metabolic effort which affects their
physiological and psychological well-being. With increasing breeding intensity, which
is necessary to obtain higher yields, the environment and farm routines are profoundly
changing. This means that farmers in intensive systems must pay more attention and
make more investments to ensure the welfare of their animals. Farm animals are partially
human-made artifacts that bear the responsibilities related to the metabolic fatigue they
endure to render the important service of producing high quality food for humanity. Their
welfare must be guaranteed in all breeding conditions and in all countries of the world.

In practical terms, current breeders have to deal with an increasing complexity in
managing farms and with the containment of production costs. The design of comfortable
environments suitable for high production needs is the first requirement for animal welfare,
followed by respect for the management of the groups and the circadian needs of the
various categories. Highly selected animals have sophisticated dietary needs not only in
quantitative terms, but above all in the way they eat their food. Breeders must take into
account specific feeding behaviors and schedule and program schedules and rations to
meet the specific needs of their animals. High production also implies greater exposure
to diseases for which farmers must adopt the best practices suggested by international
organizations [107]. Finally, the complexity of managing a modern livestock farm requires
continuous training of the staff and the careful vigilance of the entrepreneur so that all legal
and company regulations are respected. It is worthy to note that animal welfare certification
is recently wide spreading throughout the implementation of the Welfare Quality (WQ)
protocols (based on the effects of the farming system on the animal condition-welfare), due
to the fact that animal welfare must be guaranteed in all breeding conditions and that people
in general, and consumers of animal products in particular, are interested in being sure that
products they consume come from animals that have been correctly reared and managed.

5. Conclusions

This review conﬁrms the hypothesis that the behavior of highly selected farm animals
is long away from its natural state. There are behavioral changes in some farm animals
compared to their wild ancestors due to genetic selection-domestication which should be
considered in planning and implementing farm animal welfare standards at the farm level
and an upgrade in the regulatory body.

Animal scientists must push governments to ensure that the welfare standards re-
quired by the regulations are universal and guide the international trade in products of
animal origin; at the same time, they must devote more and more research spaces to make
available scientiﬁc elements and technologies capable of making this reality operational
and at acceptable costs everywhere.
