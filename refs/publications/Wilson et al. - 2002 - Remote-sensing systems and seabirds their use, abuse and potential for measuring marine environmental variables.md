ABSTRACT:  We  examined  how  seabirds  might  be  used  to  study  marine  environmental  variables,
which  necessitates  knowing  location  and  the  value  of  the  variable  to  be  studied.  Five  systems  can
potentially be used for determination of location: VHF (Very High Frequency) telemetry, PTT (Plat-
form  Terminal  Transmitters)  telemetry,  GLS  (Global  Location  Service)  geolocation  methods,  dead
reckoning and GPS (Global Positioning System), each with its own advantages with respect to accu-
racy, potential number of fixes and size. Temperature and light were used to illustrate potential diffi-
culties in recording environmental variables. Systems currently used on seabirds for measurement of
temperature respond slowly to environmental changes; thus, they may not measure sea surface tem-
perature adequately when contact periods with water bodies are too short. Light can be easily mea-
sured for light extinction studies, but sensor orientation plays a large role in determining recorded val-
ues. Both problems can be corrected. The foraging behaviour of seabirds was also examined in order
to identify those features which would be useful for determination of marine environmental variables
at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. Area coverage by birds is highly dependent on breeding
phase  and  tends  to  be  concentrated  in  areas  where  prey  acquisition  is  particularly  enhanced.  The
identification of these sites may be of particular interest to marine biologists. ‘Plungers’ and ‘divers’
are  potentially  most  useful  for  assessment  of  variables  deeper  within  the  water  column,  with  some
divers spending up to 90% of their time sub-surface. Few seabirds exploit the water column deeper
than 20 m, although some divers regularly exceed 50 m (primarily penguins and auks), while 2 species
dive  in  excess  of  300  m.  The  wide-ranging  behaviour  of  seabirds  coupled,  in  many  instances,  with
their substantial body size makes them potentially excellent carriers of sophisticated environmental
measuring technology; however, the ethical question of how much the well-being of birds can, and
should, be compromised by such an approach needs to be carefully considered.

INTRODUCTION

The  intimate  relationship  between  many  marine
endotherms and the sea has prompted some workers to

suggest that aspects of the oceans can be elucidated by
studying  the  endotherms  themselves.  For  example,
studies  of  seabird  feeding  habits,  growth  rates  and
survival  have  been  related  to  local  prey  abundance
(e.g. Cairns 1987, Montevecchi 1993, Monaghan 1996,
Montevecchi  &  Myers  1996)  and  both  marine  mam-

mals  and  seabirds  have  been  used  to  examine  the
extent  of  pollutants  in  areas  utilised  by  the  animals
(e.g.  Furness  &  Camphuysen  1997,  Mossner  &  Ball-
schmitter 1997, Beckmen et al. 1999, Hunt et al. 1999).
However,  recent  advances  in  solid  state  technology
have  made  it  possible  to  equip  many  marine  endo-
therms with devices during their forays at sea so as to
determine animal movements and habits (e.g. Bost et
al.  1997,  McCafferty  et  al.  1999),  and,  in  a  further
refinement of the technology, it is now possible to mea-
sure some environmental variables with these devices
(e.g. Weimerskirch et al. 1995). As a result of this, it has
been  suggested  that  marine  endotherms,  appropri-
ately equipped, could be used to measure and monitor
the  physical  properties  of  the  oceans  in  which  they
forage,  with  specific  localities  being  ascribed  specific
measurements  (e.g.  Wilson  1992,  1999,  Wilson  et  al.
1993, Weimerskirch et al. 1995, Boyd 1997, Campaña
et  al.  2000,  Georges  et  al.  2000,  Koudil  et  al.  2000).
Although  this  concept  is  gaining  in  popularity,  there
has never been any critical assessment of the features
necessary  in  the  technology  to  make  the  concept
genuinely  feasible,  nor  has  the  behaviour  of  marine
endotherms  been  examined  in  detail  to  assess  what
features of their behaviour might prove advantageous
for such a purpose.

This paper considers some of the tools available for
studying  the  foraging  behaviour  of  seabirds:  we  con-
sider  potential  sources  of  error  in  proposed  position-
determining systems used on free-living marine endo-

therms  and  consider  the  types  of  error  that  might  be
incurred  by  using  sensors  to  measure  environmental
variables. We examine selected information in order to
present  how  marine  endotherm  behaviour  leads  the
animals  to  sample  specific  volumes  of  the  ocean.
Finally,  we  briefly  consider  rough  guidelines  regard-
ing  the  ethics  of  equipping  animals  with  remote-
sensing technology with a view to elucidating aspects
of  ocean  ecology.  This  work  is  not  intended  to  be  an
exhaustive  review  and,  for  the  sake  of  brevity  in  a
broad  field,  we  have  limited  ourselves  to  seabirds,
relying  heavily  on  our  own  work,  some  of  which  has
not  been  previously  published.  This  gives  readers  a
chance  to  assess  the  potential  in  recently  developed
systems  or  systems  that  have,  as  yet,  no  commercial
outlet.

Rather than give an exhaustive list of all the locali-
ties,  species  and  techniques  covered  by  the  multiple
authors, we present a brief overview below and refer
to  details,  where  relevant,  later  in  the  text.  The  field
work which provides the basis for this paper was con-
ducted between 1987 and 1999 at various sites in and
around  Antarctica  (including  sub-Antarctic  islands),
Argentina,  South  Africa  and  the  UK  on  14  species  of
seabirds  (Table  1)  (see  also,  e.g.  Wilson  et  al.  1993,
Weimerskirch 1998a, Grémillet et al. 2000). Birds were

variously  equipped  with  position-determining  units
and dataloggers (Table 2).

Position-determining  units. VHF  transmitters  were
TW3 2-stage transmitters equipped with 2 aerials (Bio-
track; mass 18 g, 30 mm long × 20 mm diam. with main
and  secondary  aerials  280  and  230  mm  long,  respec-
tively), with a mean pulse rate of 1.3 pulses s–1.

The platform terminal transmitters (PTTs) that have
been  used  on  seabirds  were  built  by  2  major  compa-
nies: Toyocom and Microwave. Since 1989, when the
first  PTTs  were  used  on  seabirds  (Toyocom  T2028,
180 g)  progressive  miniaturisation  in  solid  state  elec-
tronics  has  resulted  in  current  PTTs  that  are  on  the
order of 20 g (for volant seabirds: Microwave). These
PTTs are powered by lithium batteries or solar panels
and transmit a signal every 60 to 90 s continuously, but
can be duty cycled, i.e. programmed to be switched off
for determined periods to allow a longer lifespan of the
batteries.  Location  of  these  PTTs  is  provided  by  the
Argos System (Argos CLS, Toulouse, France).

Global Location System sensors (GLSs) or geolocat-
ing  devices  were  used  as  simple,  single-channel  log-
gers or as part of multiple-channel loggers incorporat-
ing  other  features.  The  single-channel  loggers  were
based on the ‘pillbox’ logger (Driesen & Kern), which
recorded data within the approximate range of 0.1 to
25 lux in a 128 kb memory with 8 bit resolution, using

a  photoelectric  sensor  covered  by  a  BG  28  blue  filter
(Schott  Glaswerke)  which  limited  the  wavelength  of
the light activating the sensor to the deep blue region
where  light  is  least  attentuated  by  cloud  cover  (see
Wilson  et  al.  in  press).  The  unit  was  encapsulated  in
resin and recorded at intervals of between 8 and 128 s.
All position-determining units were attached to birds
by using waterproof, cloth-backed Tesa tape (Wilson et
al. 1997), at 1 of 3 sites: to a Darvic ring placed around
the leg; to feathers in the centre of birds’ backs (dorsal,
mid-line),  except  in  the  case  of  penguins,  where  the
units  were  placed  posterior  to  this,  following  sugges-
tions  in  Bannasch  et  al.  (1994),  or  to  tail  feathers
(Wanless et al. 1991). Maximum wearing times for the
various methods were up to 8 mo for the rings, 3 mo for
the back feathers and 2.5 mo for the tail feathers.

Environmental  variables. Except  for  GLS  applica-
tions  (see  above),  we  used  2  types  of  single-channel
loggers,  both  to  measure  temperature  (Wilson  et  al.
1995c)  (Table  2).  Both  units  were  attached  by  using
waterproof, cloth-backed Tesa tape (Wilson et al. 1997)
to attach them to Darvic rings placed on birds’ legs, for
wearing periods of up to 2 mo.

We  used  a  total  of  6  types  of  multiple-channel  log-
gers with various hardware formats; details are listed
in Table 2. Where the units were used as GLSs, all light
sensors were covered with a BG 28 blue filter (Schott

Glaswerke),  and  light  values  were  stored  at  intervals
ranging between 2 and 120 s within the approximate
range of 0.1 to 80 000 lux.

Variables monitored by the loggers were resolved by
8, 10, 12 or 16 bits in memories ranging between 32 kb
and 2 Mb (Table 2). In addition to light, these variables
were:
• temperature within the range 0 to 50°C
• depth (via hydrostatic pressure) within the range 2 to

40 bar,

• flight  height  (via  air  pressure)  to  a  maximum  of

1.5 bar absolute pressure,

• swim or flight speed (via diffential pressure using a

Prandl tube) within the range 0.001 to 1 bar,

• direction using a miniature magnetic ship’s compass
where the orientation of the unit with respect to that
of the bird is sensed by Hall sensors (Hochscheid &
Wilson 1999)
More specific details regarding the characteristics of
the units attached to birds are given in Weimerskirch
et  al.  (1992,  1993)  and  Weimerskirch  (1998a,b)  for
PTTs,  Grémillet  et  al.  (1999)  for  VHF  transmitters,
Wilson  et  al.  (in  press)  for  GLSs  and  in  Wilson  et  al.
(1993, 1995c) for the loggers.

Multiple-channel  loggers  were  either  attached  to
Darvic  rings  on  birds’  legs  using  tape  (Wilson  et  al.
1997) or were attached to birds’ backs by taping them
to  feathers  (Wilson  et  al.  1997).  Wearing  periods  for
both leg-attached as well as back-attached units were
up to 8 mo.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

To  use  seabirds  as  effective  monitors  of  the  marine
environment  3  major  issues  are  of  relevance:  the
quality of the positional fixes, the quality of the envi-
ronmental data gathered by the birds and the utility of
the sampling regime that the birds provide by virtue of
their behaviour.

Quality of positional fixes

Geographic location

There  are  4  major  methods  for  determination  of
seabird  geographic  location  currently  being  used
(VHF  transmitters,  satellite  transmitters,  global  loca-
tion sensors, dead reckoners) and a fifth that is likely to
be implemented within the next 2 yr (Global Position-
ing System, GPS).

VHF  transmitters. VHF  transmitters  (e.g.  Kenward
1987) have been used extensively on seabirds since the
1970s (e.g. Morris & Black 1980, Wanless et al. 1991)

and  are  of  limited  application  since  they  require  that
receiving  units  remain  within  sight  contact  of  the
transmitters.  This  has  meant  that  researchers  have
only deployed such systems with inshore species (e.g.
Grémillet et al. 1999) or have had to go to considerable
trouble  to  follow  birds  at  sea  with  mobile  receiving
units,  something  that  is  only  practicable  with  slowly
moving species such as penguins (e.g. Heath & Randall
1989).  In  addition,  radio  waves  are  not  transmitted
appreciably  through  seawater,  so  species  that  spend
much time diving, or foraging in areas where the swell
is substantial, can be problematic (but see Wanless &
Harris 1992). The overall maximum range of a shore-
based,  radio-tracking  system  is  approximately  50  km
(D.G.  unpubl.  data).  This  can  be  substantially  in-
creased if mobile receiving units are used (e.g. Heath
&  Randall  1989),  but  such  steps  are  generally  costly
and  labour  intensive.  The  overall  reception  quality,
irrespective of whether the receiving unit is mobile or
stationary,  is  not  only  dependent  on  the  curvature  of
the earth and the merit of the receiving unit, but also
on  local  topography  and  mineralogy  as  well  as  local
radio  traffic  and  interference  from,  for  example,  the
proximity  of  2-stroke  engines  (Kenward  1987,  D.G.
unpubl.  data).  The  suitability  of  a  particular  area  for
radio-telemetry  studies  is  therefore  best  decided  in
trials  on  site.  The  bearings  recorded  at  2  separate
tracking stations are usually combined to estimate the
at-sea position of the equipped animal using triangula-
tion. The overall accuracy of the acquired position can
be assessed using error polygons, whereby the errors
in the 2 bearings (each typically between 2 and 5°; cf.
Kato et al. 1998) are calculated into arcs, the width of
each  of  which  increases  with  the  distance  between
transmitter  and  receiver  (see  White  &  Garrott  1990).
The width of the arcs at the point where the 2 bearings
overlap determines the size of the error polygon, which
becomes greater the more acute the angle between the
2  bearings  is  (White  &  Garrott  1990).  Errors  in  posi-
tional estimation of seabirds are typically of the order
of 2 km (e.g. Kato et al. 1998). The surface area of each
polygon,  which  describes  the  area  within  which  the
bird is situated, as well as its travelling speed, deter-
mines the rate at which fixes can be effectively taken.
This rate, therefore, may vary from a few seconds dur-
ing fast power flight (up to 18 m s–1; Pennycuick 1997)
up to several hours in flightless offshore species. The
use of 3 or more tracking stations instead of the usual
2 may help detect erroneous bearings, but is unlikely
to increase the overall accuracy of the system signifi-
cantly (White & Garrott 1990).

Satellite  tracking  transmitters. PTTs  have  proved
invaluable for determination of the movements of far-
ranging seabirds, in particular albatrosses (see review
in  Weimerskirch  1998a,  see  also  Benvenuti  1993)

Wilson et al.: Monitoring the oceans using seabirds

although  smaller  birds  that  forage  less  widely  have
also  been  equipped  (e.g.  Peterson  &  Douglas  1994,
Falk & Moller 1995, Meyers et al. 1998). Radio-signals
transmitted by the units are received and localised by
orbiting satellites so that the foraging range does not
affect  the  ability  to  obtain  a  positional  fix.  However,
currently  the  sole  PTT  service  is  based  on  the  Argos
receiving  system  placed  on  satellites  with  a  polar
orbit, which means that the number of passes effected
per  day,  when  a  PTT  at  a  particular  position  can  be
localised, is greater at the poles (28 passes) than at the
equator (8 passes) (Taillade 1992, Argos User Manual
2000). In addition, as with VHF transmitters, there is no
signal transmission when the unit is underwater so that
species that spend much time diving generate a sub-
stantially lower rate of positional fixes than non-divers
(cf.  Davis  &  Miller  1992,  Bost  et  al.  1997,  Hull  et  al.
1997). Similarly, the number of satellite passes over a
particular location is not constant per unit time so that
the number of locations may be substantially lower at
some  times  than  at  others  (Georges  et  al.  1997).  This
means that even if the study animal is accessible to the
satellite  at  all  times,  such  as  is  nominally  the  case  in
non-divers,  the  movements  of  the  animal  cannot  be
determined at regular intervals.

The  Argos  system  (Service  Argos  1996)  provides  7
classes  of  accuracy,  in  order  of  decreasing  accuracy
from  3,  2,  1,  0,  A,  B  to  Z.  Argos  gives  an  accuracy
(within 1 SD) for 4 classes (Class 3 = 150 m, Class 2 =
350 m, Class 1 = 1 km, Class 0 > 1 km). A, B and Z have
no specified accuracy. The quality of the fixes and the
proportion  of  each  quality  fix  depend  on  several  fac-
tors,  among  others,  the  manufacturer,  the  model  of
PTT, the power of the transmissions, and the speed of
the animal (Weimerskirch et al. 1992) or its behaviour
(diving  or  flying).  Independent  tests  of  PTT  accuracy
with the PTT at a fixed and known location have been
performed  to  assess  the  error  (Weimerskirch  et  al.
1992,  Brothers  et  al.  1998),  and  indicate  that  average
error values are poorer than those provided by the sys-
tem for the locations 3 and 2 (300 and 500 m on aver-
age) but close to predicted values for locations of Class

1. The accuracy of the other location fixes is very vari-
able, being very high for some locations and very poor
for  others.  This  sort  of  analysis  does  not,  however,
accurately reflect the quite different conditions neces-
sitated when a positional fix has to be derived from a
flying or diving bird. Burns & Castellini (1998) consid-
ered the quality of satellite tracking fixes derived from
free-living  Weddell  seals  Leptonychotes  weddellii by
comparing  it  with  simultaneously  derived  GPS  fixes
(see  later).  They  found  that  the  actual  accuracy  was
considerably  worse  than  that  given  by  Argos,  with
Classes 0 and 1 fixes having mean errors of 11.4 and
5.0 km,  respectively,  with  errors  in  latitude  being

greater than those of longitude. In the case of the Class
1 fixes, this is an error of some 500% more than that
stipulated by Argos (Service Argos predicts that 68%
of all Class 1 fixes should fall within 1 km of the true
location; Service Argos 1996).

Global  Location  Service  sensors /geolocation. GLS
sensors  have  been  used  only  relatively  recently  and
were developed to answer to 2 principle needs: as an
alternative  to  satellite  tracking  systems  for  species
which spend insufficient time at the surface to get reli-
able  position  fixes  (Delong  et  al.  1992,  Block  et  al.
1998),  and  for  deployment  on  species  which  are  con-
sidered too small to carry the rather bulky PTTs. Many
GLS sensors used today weigh under 20 g, and there is
considerable room for improvement because no power
pack  or  aerial  is  needed  for  transmission  telemetry.
These  systems  log  light  intensity  at  regular  intervals
for extended periods on a highly accurate Greenwich
mean time (GMT) time base. Upon retrieval of the unit,
the  light  intensity  values  are  used  to  determine  the
local times of dawn and dusk which are used to derive
daylength and local time of midday and midnight as a
function of the day of the year. Daylength can then be
used to derive latitude and the local time of midday or
midnight used to derive longitude (Wilson et al. 1992a,
in press,  Hill 1994, Welch & Eveson 1999). The process
allows 2 fixes per 24 h, one taken to be the bird’s posi-
tion at midday and the other at midnight, with no lati-
tude fixes possible for between 10 and 21 d on either
side of the equinox. Recent algorithms used to derive
position take into account potential changes in bird po-
sition between dawn and dusk and vice versa by con-
sidering the total day plus night length which should
be ca. 24 h if the bird has moved little and need to be
corrected  if  birds  move  extensively  (Wilson  et  al.  in
press). The accuracy of positional fixes is much lower
than  that  achieved  by  satellite  telemetry  and  depen-
dent on a number of environmental and animal-depen-
dent variables such as cloud cover, diving behaviour of
the animal around dawn and dusk and light sensor ori-
entation  at  the  time  measurements  are  made.  Many
errors  can  be  reduced  by  measures  such  as  by  using
filters to cover the sensor or by smoothing data during
analysis (Wilson et al. in press). Nonetheless, logging
light intensity once every 60 s, and using an algorithm
presented  in  Wilson  et  al.  (in  press)  we  achieved  a
mean maximum positional accuracy of 18.8 km (SD =
13.2, n = 78) from ideally placed, stationary GLSs. The
overall accuracy of GLS sensors on free-living animals
is  difficult  to  assess  because  packages  involving  2
position-determining units are generally unacceptably
large  (cf.  Bannasch  et  al.  1994).  However,  when  we
placed  GLSs  simultaneously  with  PTTs  on  a  King
penguin Aptenodytes patagonicus foraging from Pos-
session Island, southern Indian Ocean, we achieved a

246

Mar Ecol Prog Ser 228: 241–261, 2002

mean  concordance  (difference  between  the  position
calculated  by  the  PTT  and  the  GLS)  of  31.3 km  (SD
30.6,  n  =  13),  even  though  these  birds  spend  a  large
proportion of the time around dawn and dusk under-
water (Pütz et al. 1998), which makes position determi-
nation less accurate (Wilson et al. in press). In addition,
based on consideration of known swim speeds and de-
viations from a straight line course, similar units placed
on  foraging  Magellanic  penguins  Spheniscus  magel-
lanicus from  Peninsula  Valdes,  Argentina,  were  con-
sidered to give an accuracy better than 40 km (Wilson
et al. 1995b). Finally, grey-headed albatross Diomedea
chrysostoma foraging from Marion Island, southern In-
dian Ocean, essentially all foraged in the same sector
of the ocean irrespective of whether they were tracked
with PTTs or GLSs (Nel et al. 2000).

It is important, however, to note that the determina-
tion of positional accuracy using GLS methodology is

ing the data (B) with and (A) without drift correction. Errors
incurred  by  drift  were  assumed  to  be  due  to  a  constant
current pushing the bird in a south-westerly direction for the
whole duration of the foraging trip, and data were corrected
accordingly

only as good as the hardware to determine light inten-
sity and the positioning of the sensor such that it can
perceive light appropriately. Recent trials with minia-
ture devices on wandering albatross Diomeda exulans
legs (Weimerskirch & Wilson 2000) showed that errors
could be as high as 200 km.

Dead  reckoning. Dead  reckoning  is  another  tech-
nique used to determine animal movements. It is based
on  determination  of  animal  speed,  heading  and
changes  in  vertical  position  (i.e.  depth)  in  an  animal-
attached archival unit. Vectorial calculations on these
values,  together  with  known  information  on  the  start
(and  end)  position  of  the  bird  allow  reconstruction  of
the  route  taken  by  the  bird  (Bramanti  et  al.  1988,
Wilson et al. 1991, 1993, Benvenuti et al. 1998, Davis et
al. 1999, Wilson 2001). Earlier versions of the compass
in  the  system  only  worked  accurately  when  close  to
horizontal (Bramanti et al. 1988, Wilson et al. 1993) so
that they were subject to considerable error in animals
that dived steeply. This problem has been eliminated
by  development  of  a  fully  3-dimensional  compass
(Davis  et  al.  1999,  Hochscheid  &  Wilson  1999).
Although  this  method  gives  finely  resolved  relative
spatial  movement  over  a  time  scale  of  a  few  seconds
(Wilson  2001),  it  is  subject  to  drift  such  that  absolute
errors in position can be substantial, with these errors
tending to increase as a function of total device deploy-
ment time. This drift is primarily incurred due to wind
and  currents  which  may  move  the  bird  even  though
the speed sensor, which detects motion relative to that
of  the  environment,  indicates  otherwise.  The  magni-
tude of drift problems can be alluded to by comparing
the  calculated  end  point  of  a  foraging  trip  with  the
known  end  point  (Bramanti  et  al.  1988).  Appropriate
software can then be used to overlay the known start
and  end  points  to  accord  with  their  true  geographic
co-ordinates and then to correct all other positions to
accord  (Fig.  1).  During  63  foraging  trips  of  49  indi-
vidual Pygoscelis penguins breeding at Ardley Island,
Antarctica, determined by dead reckoning, where start
and finish positions of the birds were known, the mean
error in the calculated end position relative to its actual
position was 1.2 km (SD = 1.8) for trips with a mean for-
aging range of 6.7 km (SD = 8.0) and a mean total trav-
elled  distance  of  18.9  km  (SD  =  17.5)  (Wilson  2001).
Superimposition of the correct end position on the pro-
jected end position will tend to lead to maximum errors
of  approximately  half  the  given  mean  (ca.  0.6  km)  at
the half-way point of the calculated route, with errors
tending  to  diminish  towards  the  start  and  end  of  the
foraging trip. It should be noted that the error due to
drift in dead reckoning systems is primarily a function
of time, rather than distance travelled because the ani-
mal  is  subject  to  drift  even  when  it  is  not  being  pro-
pelled by its own means. The absolute amount of drift

Wilson et al.: Monitoring the oceans using seabirds

247

depends on behaviour, e.g. flying, resting on the water,
etc. The viability of dead reckoning over a time scale of
days  has  yet  to  be  tested,  and  its  utility  will  depend
greatly  on  the  current/wind  conditions  at  the  time.  It
is perhaps  worth  noting  that  in  a  technically  perfect
dead  reckoning  system,  errors  in  positional  calcula-
tions could be used to infer ambient current conditions.
The overall utility of dead reckoning would be greatly
enhanced  by  combining  it  with  some  other,  indepen-
dent  measure  of  position,  such  as  via  GPS  so  that
absolute,  infrequent  satellite-determined  fixes  could
be used to correct for drift-incurred errors in the dead
reckoning system (Wilson 2001).

Global Positioning System. GPS receivers have been
used successfully on some marine mammals (e.g. Sisak
1998)  and  for  short  periods  on  homing  pigeons  (von
Hünerbein et al. 2000). This system has been deployed
on seabirds for the first time over the last few months
(Fig. 2). As with PTTs, this technology cannot be used
underwater, but, since there are 24 relevant satellites
orbiting the earth, a fix can be acquired at any time the
animal  is  at  the  surface.  The  time  needed  for  a  posi-
tional fix varies between 30 s and 15 min depending on
the  accuracy  of  information  on  the  animal’s  position
already  stored  in  the  unit  although  a  continuously
functioning GPS can update position once every 1 s or
so (Kaplan 1996). Immediately prior to the year 2000,
GPS  had  an  accuracy  which  was  long  term,  consis-
tently better than all systems considered above, being
approximately  100  m  for  normal  GPS  and  <10  m  for
differentially corrected GPS (Kaplan 1996). On 1 May
2000, the US Department of Defence discontinued the
selective  availability  (S/A)  policy  which  deliberately
degraded  the  accuracy  of  GPS.  This  improves  the
receiver accuracy by a factor of about 10 so that errors
can  be  expected  to  be  within  ca.  5  m  for  95%  of  the
fixes  (von  Hünerbein  et  al.  2000).  Although  data
loggers for GPS are currently too large to be used on
most seabirds, projected size reduction makes it likely
that they will be applicable to a fairly wide spectrum of
species in the near future. The accuracy of the system
and the large number of positional fixes means that the
use  of  GPS  technology  is  likely  to  revolutionise  our
understanding of seabird movements at sea and their
potential use as a monitor of the marine environment.
In summary, the above systems all give information
on geographic position with a variety of different accu-
racies. With the exception of GPS, all accuracies ascer-
tained by fixed location trials appear to decrease when
the  units  are  placed  on  free-living  animals  due  to
movement,  diving,  etc.  Determination  of  these  errors
is problematic  since  there  is  no  system  for  ground
truthing  acquired  data,  although  certain,  fortuitous,
events, such as the presence of albatrosses far inland,
may  give  certain  minimum  error  estimates.  Similarly,

Fig.  2.  First  8  h  of  movement  of  a  wandering  albatross  Dia-
meda  exulans  leaving  Possession  Island,  Crozet  Islands,  as
estimated by a miniature GPS. Dots indicate where the bird
alighted  on  the  water  (Weimerskirch,  Bonnadona,  Mabille,
Bailleul & Lipp unpubl. data)

equipment  of  animals  simultaneously  with  2  systems
makes it difficult to ascribe inconsistencies in the posi-
tions  completely  to  either  one  system  or  the  other,
although  errors  are  usually  ascribed  to  the  system
considered to be less accurate. This will change when
miniaturised  GPS  systems  can  be  deployed  on  sea-
birds, but until that time we will have to make do with
rather imprecise values for positional errors. The rate
at  which  fixes  can  be  provided  is  critically  important
when  oceanographic  variables  are  to  be  monitored
virtually  continuously.  In  this  respect,  even  the  most
accurate  system  becomes  correspondingly  less  useful
as  the  frequency  with  which  positional  fixes  can  be
determined  decreases  because  the  projected  position
of the bird has to be interpolated between points. An
ideal compromise is perhaps a combination of systems
such as dead reckoning together with PTTs or GPS, as
suggested  above.  Ultimately,  however,  the  system  to
be used for positional information must be decided by
the questions being asked in the study.

Depth

The accurate determination of the depths exploited
by seabirds is also highly relevant if the 3-dimensional
position  of  the  variable  to  be  measured  is  to  be
quantified.  Three  elements  are  important  in  this
regard:  the  accuracy  of  the  pressure  transducer,  the
resolution of the recording system and the correctness
of the temperature compensation within the measuring
unit.  The  ability  of  the  sensor  to  measure  changes  in

248

Mar Ecol Prog Ser 228: 241–261, 2002

ambient  pressure  correctly  depends  primarily  on  the
size of the pressure-sensitive surface, the larger units
generally  being  more  accurate.  This  is  unfortunate
because  smaller  units  are  clearly  more  desirable  for
deployment on seabirds. Systems available today gen-
erally  vary  in  resolution  between  8  and  16  bits  (see
above),  giving  255  and  65 535  measurement  steps
respectively  over  the  sensor’s  specified  range.  Obvi-
ously, 16 bit resolution makes determination of utilised
depths  much  more  accurate,  assuming  the  pressure
transducer  is  good  enough,  because  the  resolution  in
depth  is  given  by  the  maximum  depth  range  divided
by  the  number  of  measurement  steps  (Fig.  3).  How-
ever,  even  the  best  pressure  transducers  resolved  to
16 bit cannot give accurate information unless they are
carefully calibrated and compensated for temperature
effects.  Seabirds  spend  much  time  at  the  water/air
interface,  and  thus  associated  loggers  are  subject  to
radical changes in temperature. For example, a black,
back-mounted  logger  on  Magellanic  penguins  may
experience temperatures of between 7 and 35°C over
relatively  short  periods  due  to  the  difference  in  tem-
perature between the water and the insolation experi-
enced by the unit when the penguin is at the surface.
An uncorrected output from a pressure transducer may
vary  by  3%  for  any  specific  pressure  under  this  tem-
perature  regime.  Thus,  a  unit  with  a  full-scale  mea-
surement of 200 m may give up to a 6 m error in depth
estimates at any position in the water column (or at the
surface) if the pressure transducer is not temperature
corrected.  Due  to  heat  flow  within  the  logger,  it  is

Fig. 3. Example of depth utilisation by a Magellanic penguin
Spheniscus  magellanicus during  a  single  dive  using  8  bit
(lines with squares) and 16 bit resolution (simple lines). The
pressure  transducer  had  a  maximum  measurement  range
of 200 m

therefore  of  critical  importance  that  the  temperature
sensor to be used for correction purposes be subject to
a  regime  as  closely  mirroring  that  of  the  pressure
transducer as possible. While this is relatively easy, it
is at  odds  with  rapid  measurement  of  environmental
temperature (see below).

Quality of the environmental data collected

There are a number of sensors available which can
be  used  to  measure  a  variety  of  environmental  vari-
ables,  both  biotic  (e.g.  quantities  of  prey  ingested:
Wilson et al. 1992b, 1995a, Charrassin et al. 2000), for
catch  per  unit  effort  statistics  and  hence  prey  densi-
ties (e.g. Wilson et al. 1993, Grémillet 1997, Garthe et
al. 1999),  and  abiotic  (e.g.  salinity:  Sturlaugsson  &
Johannsson  1996).  Oceanographers  and  marine  eco-
system  researchers  are  interested  in  examining  a
number  of  major  variables,  these  being  temperature,
density,  salinity,  light  extinction,  oxygen,  dissolved
organic  carbon,  dissolved  organic  nitrogen,  dissolved
organic  phosphorus  and  chlorophyll  a (e.g.  Birot  et
al. 1998, Longhurst 1998). Topics requiring such data
cover a vast scope of areas from analysis of small-scale
plankton blooms to global circulation models, includ-
ing El Niño and global climate change. To date, how-
ever, we know of only 2 variables that have been mon-
itored by use of seabirds, these being temperature and
light, and it is to these that we will restrict ourselves in
order  to  illustrate  the  general  principles  and  pitfalls
which need to be considered.

Temperature

Measurement  of  sea  temperature  is  considered  of
major  importance  for  marine  environmental  monitor-
ing.  Classically  it  is  performed  by  ship-borne  CTD
casts  which  give  vertical  temperature  profiles  of
selected stations (e.g. Pond & Pickard 1983).

Almost  all  loggers  currently  used  on  seabirds  have
the  capacity  to  measure  ambient  temperature.  How-
ever, the original function of this is derived from tem-
perature compensation of other transducers in the unit
so that the emplacement of the temperature sensor is,
or  should  be,  linked  to  the  position  of  these  sensors
(see  above).  To  what  extent  do  temperature  sensors
so placed lend themselves to reliable measurement of
ambient temperature, given the highly mobile nature
of  seabirds  and  their  tendency  to  expose  themselves
to a widely ranging temperature regime? There are 2
situations  to  be  considered  here:  measurement  of
SST and  measurement  of  temperature  as  a  function
of depth.

Wilson et al.: Monitoring the oceans using seabirds

Sea  surface  temperature. The  first  situation  is  best
exemplified by volant species, with leg-mounted log-
gers,  which  travel  above  the  water’s  surface  before
alighting for some period before taking off again. Dur-
ing  flight  the  temperature  recorded  by  the  logger  is
generally  fairly  high,  on  the  order  of  25°C,  since  the
unit is often tucked up in the feathers. At the moment
the  bird  alights  and  extends  its  feet  into  the  water
column the measured temperature drops precipitously
(Fig. 4a), with the rate of change of temperature being,
in  some  way,  proportional  to  the  difference  between
measured  and  actual  temperature  (Fig.  4b).  Thus,
although loggers measuring temperature may readily
indicate when birds have alighted on the water, con-
siderable  time  may  elapse  before  the  measured  tem-
perature has dropped to that of the surface. If the time
period  necessary  for  the  temperature  sensor  of  the
logger to stabilise does not occur before the bird takes
flight  again,  then  the  SST  cannot  be  accurately
measured.  To  put  the  qualities  of  existing  loggers
into perspective, we considered the rate of change of
measured temperature from various loggers in water-
baths  simulating  a  bird  landing  on  the  sea  surface.
There  were  substantial  differences  between  the  vari-
ous logger types (Table 3), with the rate of change of
temperature being dependent on the proximity of the
sensor  to  the  water  on  all  sides.  Units  with  superfi-
cially embedded temperature sensors on 1 side initially
reacted quickly to the change in ambient temperature
(cf.  Wildlife  Computers  in  Table  3);  however,  a  sub-
stantial mass of embedding resin on the other side of
the  sensor  slowed  the  rate  of  change  of  measured
temperature radically following this initial rapid drop
so that the time necessary for the units to reach base
levels was considerably longer than other units where
the  mean  overall  distance  between  sensor  and  water
was  less  (Table  3).  It  is  notable  that  no  single  unit
reached true base levels (or 99% thereof) before 62 s,
and that some units did not stabilise temperatures until
564 s (Table 3). These represent miminum time periods
that  birds  must  spend  on  the  water  before  the  SST
measurement  can  be  effected.  This
necessary time period might be some-
what shortened by deriving a general
curve  fit  for  measured  temperature
against time but such a process will be
less precise and, in any event, necessi-
tates a high sampling frequency which
is not always practical.

Time (s)
to reach:

The  reactivity  of  the  sensor  need
not be  a  problem  provided  that  the
equipped  bird  spends  an  appreciable
amount of time on the water. It would
appear,  however,  that  at  least  some
species  of  seabirds  alight  on  the

dives terminating at deeper depths; rates are typically
between  0.7  and  1.9  m  s–1 for  cormorants  (Wilson  &
Wilson  1988,  Croxall  et  al  1991,  Wanless  et  al.  1993,
Watanuki  et  al.  1996,  Grémillet  et  al.  1998),  around
0.9 m s–1 for auks (Croll et al. 1992, Clowater & Burger
1994)  and  between  0.7  and  2.2  m  s–1 for  penguins
(Kooyman & Kooyman 1995, Wilson et al. 1996, Peters
et al. 1998, Pütz et al. 1998, Wilson & Peters 1999). This
means  that  birds  typically  spend  <1.5  s  per  vertical
metre  depth  in  the  water  column.  Thus,  slowly  re-
sponding temperature sensors within loggers (Table 3)
will  never  equilibrate  to  any  particular  temperature
down  the  water  column  which  leads  to  recorded
changes in temperature due to changes in depth being
out of synchrony with actual changes in depth so that
the regression of temperature against depth results in
an ambiguous relationship (Fig. 6a). Simplistically, one
could  attempt  to  determine  the  form  of  temperature
against  depth  by  taking  means  of  equivalent  points
from  the  descending  and  ascending  parts  of  the  dive
profile, but in practise this is not correct.

What properties should a temperature sensor have if
it is to be used to measure water temperature as a func-
tion of depth in a diving seabird? We consider that T0
is the initial temperature at time t = 0, T1 is the temper-
ature that the sensor has to reach, being T at infinite
time, and that t99 is the time the sensor needs to adjust
to 99% of the temperature change T1 – T0. Our general
assumption  is  that  the  rate  of  change  of  temperature
takes the form:

dT /dt =  µ(T1 – T(t))

where µ is a constant. Thus:

Tt =  T1 – (T1 – T0)e–µt

and the sensor reaches 99% of (T1 – T0) if e–µt = 0.99,
that is:

t99 ≤ 1/(βD + α)    or    t99 ≈ 0.01/µ
where α and β are both constants. If the rate of descent
Vv = βD + α (Wilson 1995), where D is depth, then the
time spent per unit depth in the water column is given
by:

Time  =  1/Vv  =  1/(βD + α)

Thus,  for  the  sensor  to  measure  temperature  effec-

tively in a diving bird:

–ln(0.99)/µ ≤ 1/(βD + α)

where we consider that effective measurement means
that the sensor must react within a metre travelled ver-
tically and that Vv is measured in m s–1.

Consideration of the reaction speed of various tem-
perature sensors (Table 3) indicates that not one of the
units currently on the market will enable researchers

(Spheniscus magellanicus) and associated rates of movement

surface  for  just  short  periods.  In  > 5%  of  the  cases  in
which black-browed albatross Diomedea melanophris
equipped  with  foot  temperature  loggers  settle  on  the
water, they do so for < 4 min, in 10% of the cases this
time is < 6 min, 50% < 29 min, 90% < 308 min (Grémillet
et al. 2000). Comparable values for the Northern Gan-
net Sula bassanus were: 10 % < 5 min, 50% <18 min,
90% < 88 min (n = 75; 3 birds) (S.G. unpubl. data).

Depth-dependent temperature measurements. Sen-
sor reactivity becomes problematic when attempts are
made to use loggers to measure temperature as a func-
tion of depth. Seabirds have dive patterns that gener-
ally  conform  to  1  of  2  major  types  which  have  been
classified  as  V-shaped  (Fig.  5)  or  U-shaped  (Fig.  5)
(Wilson  et  al.  1996,  see  also  Schreer  &  Testa  1996).
Rates  of  change  of  depth  during  the  descent  and
ascent  phases  are  depth-dependent,  being  higher  for

Wilson et al.: Monitoring the oceans using seabirds

251

to derive temperature against depth easily for
the  rate  at  which  seabirds  tend  to  move
through the water column during the descent
phases of the dive. Furthermore, few seabirds
spend such extended periods during the bot-
tom phases of dives that the t99 for the logger
can  be  reached  and,  even  where  this  is  the
case  (e.g.  compare  Emperor  and  King  pen-
guins;  Kooyman  et  al.  1992,  Robertson  1995,
Pütz  et  al.  1998)  only  1  data  point  can  be
acquired per dive for each locality.

The solution to the problem is to incorporate
a second temperature sensor into the logging
unit  which  is  not  used  to  compensate  other
transducers  (Fig.  6b,c).  This  sensor  can  be
placed  to  project  away  from  the  body  of  the
logger  and  minimally  surrounded  by  any
material with thermal inertia. Examination of
some  of  the  commercially  available  sensors
indicates  that  some  achieve  t99 within  a
fraction of a second and would be well suited
for  this  purpose.  Wildlife  Computers  (USA)
already market a logger (Mk VII) which has a
temperature sensor on the end of a stalk, the
principal  application  for  this  being  deploy-
ment  on  fish.  The  manufacturer’s  specifica-
tions are that when this stalk is 100 mm long,
the time taken for the unit to register a 63.3%
change is 2.8 s, although whether such a stalk
can  safely  project  from  a  seabird’s  leg  is  an-
other consideration.

Light

Quantification  of  the  optical  properties  of
oceans  is  also  fundamental  in  any  com-
prehensive  oceanographic  programme  since
light  is  a  prerequisite  of  photosynthesis  (e.g.
Tyler  1977).  Instrumentation  ranges  from
classical  in  situ Secchi  disk  measurements
(Tyler  1968)  to  remotely  performed  spectral
analyses (e.g. Spinrad et al. 1994).

Diving  birds  can  very  easily  be  used  to
measure changes in light as they move up and
down  the  water  column  (e.g.  Wanless  et  al.
1999),  and  such  measurements  do  not  incur
the lag problems of the type discussed above
for temperature (Fig. 6a,b). The sensor itself is
typically  a  photo-diode  or  photo-voltaic  cell
which  is  assessed  by  the  logging  unit  over  a
period  of  a  few  milliseconds.  Sensors  gener-
ally  measure  over  a  wide  range  of  wave-
lengths  (Fig.  7a,b)  (e.g.  see  the  BPX  sensor
cited in Wanless et al. 1999, which measures

within  the  broad  band  of  350  to  1100  nm)  such  that
judicious use of filters over the sensor makes it possible
to measure light extinction patterns of highly specific
wavelengths within the full visual spectrum, according
to requirements (Spinrad et al. 1994). Units measuring
light can do so with varying degrees of resolution (up
to 16 bit) within a variety of selected ranges. For exam-
ple,  the  Wildlife  Computers  Mk  V  light  sensor  mea-
sures  light  in  a  range  of  at  least  –1.3 log10 to  3.8 log10
lux  (data  in  Wanless  et  al.  1999)  and  the  DK  logger
units  (Table  2)  can  measure  light  of  intensities
between –2 log10 and 3 log10 lux in steps of ca. 0.03 lux
and is easily sensitive enough to measure biolumines-

cence  at  night  (manufacturers’  specifications,  R.W.
unpubl. data). This compares favourably with conven-
tional oceanography (Jerlov 1976, Spinrad et al. 1994).
However,  measurement  of  light  is  not  completely
unproblematic. Birds descending in the water column
do so at a variety of angles (e.g. Wilson 1995) such that
the  angle  at  which  the  light  impinges  on  the  sensor
varies accordingly, producing a correspondingly vari-
able output (Fig. 7a). The problem of light extinction is,
in any event, complicated by sun angle which is a func-
tion  of  time  of  day,  day  of  the  year  and  geographic
location,  because  the  depth  to  which  light  will  pene-
trate down the water column is dependent on the angle
at which it impinges (Jerlov 1976). In order to
appropriately address the above complexities
of  light  extinction  curves,  3  approaches  are
possible: (1) the sensor angle can be ignored
and  some  measure  of  light  extinction  versus
depth  can  be  derived  with  inherent  scatter
(Wanless et al. 1999) (Fig. 7a); (2) the logging
unit can contain a sensor to indicate when it is
horizontal so that the angle at which the light
impinges on the sensor can be held constant;
and  (3)  a  sensor  could  be  built  into  the  log-
ging unit so that the exact angle of the sensor
can  be  determined  at  any  time  and  the  re-
corded  light  values  appropriately  handled.
The second case, although relatively easy to
realise,  gives  relatively  few  data  since  most
diving birds are only horizontal at the point of
maximum depth. The third case necessitates
some complex mechanism to determine bird
angle with respect to gravity and to the ordi-
nal  compass  system  (see  e.g.  Davis  et  al.
1999).  Apart  from  Davis  and  coworkers,  a
system  of  this  type  has  been  realised  in  a
3-dimensional,  miniature  ship’s  compass
which has been described in its basic form by
Hochscheid  &  Wilson  (1999)  and  which  can
be  used  underwater  to  determine  animal
orientation  (Storch  et  al.  in  press,  cf.  Hoch-
scheid  et  al.  1999).  Details  of  the  errors  of
the system have not been published yet, but
laboratory  work  indicates  that  both  orienta-
tion and dive angle can be resolved to better
than 4° (R.W. unpubl. data).

attached to the back of a Magellanic penguin Spheniscus magellanicus
foraging  near  Cabo  Virgenes,  Argentina.  Although  there  is  no  lag  in
response time of the sensor, scatter is noticeable in the shallower zones.
This  is  due  to  variation  in  the  orientation  of  the  bird  so  that  the  light
impinges at a highly variable angle on the sensor. In the deeper areas
the bird will tend to be swimming approximately parallel to the water
surface during the bottom phase of the dive. (b) Measured blue versus
red light intensity for the 4 major dives depicted in (a)

Sampling regime effected by the birds

Having  detailed  the  technology  for  deter-
mination of bird position as well as measure-
ment  of  abiotic  marine  variables  it  is  appro-
priate  to  consider  the  way  in  which  seabird
foraging behaviour leads to a particular sam-

Wilson et al.: Monitoring the oceans using seabirds

pling regime of the environment. In this, it is important
to remember that seabirds do not forage randomly, but
process  a  variety  of  complex  environmental  inputs
(e.g. Hutchinson et al. 1984, Nevitt et al. 1995) in order
to make decisions about which areas to sample (Wilson
& Peters 1999). Thus, they do not exhibit specific orbits,
as do satellites, nor do they move with currents, as do
drifter buoys. The decision-making process regarding
areas of perceived importance makes seabirds funda-
mentally different from all other sampling methodolo-
gies  used  to  date.  Indeed,  their  identification  of  prey
aggregations (e.g. Cairns & Schneider 1990, Hunt et al.
1990)  gives  a  fortuitous  bias  so  that  environmental
monitoring via seabird studies should be seen as par-
ticularly important.

Space utilisation during the nesting season

Birds with eggs or chicks are central place foragers
(Orians & Pearson 1979), having to return to their nest
site periodically to attend to the constraints imposed by
the  brood.  The  length  of  the  foraging  trip  and  the
travelling  speed  determine  the  theoretical  maximum
range that a breeding seabird might cover (e.g. Lish-
man  1985).  However,  in  reality,  deviations  from  a
straight line course (Wilson 2001) coupled with highly
variable  activities  at  sea  (Jouventin  &  Weimerskirch
1990)  makes  calculation  of  area  coverage  using  such
measurements overly simplistic.

There are essentially 3 phases to foraging trips. Trips
generally begin with a phase during which birds move
rapidly  and  directly  away  from  the  nest  site  (e.g.
Bethge et al. 1997, Gaston & Jones 1998, Weimerskirch
1998a,b), a behaviour which allows them to minimise
time  in  zones  where  prey  density  is  low  (Birt  et  al.
1987,  Irons  1998).  At  some  point  the  behaviour
changes  substantially  when  active  search  begins.  In
species  such  as  auks  or  cormorants,  where  prey  are
located during dives made from the surface (Johnsgard
1993,  Gaston  &  Jones  1998),  the  birds  alight  on  the
water  and  begin  diving.  If  prey  densities  are  high
enough the birds remain at this site. If not, they move
elsewhere and begin the process again (Benvenuti et
al. 1998, Falk et al. 1999, Grémillet et al. 1999). In other
species, such as many albatrosses and penguins, which
do not substantially alter travelling mode during forag-
ing,  the  tracks  become  more  meandering  as  birds
invest time searching restricted areas more thoroughly
(Jouventin  et  al.  1994,  Wilson  1995,  2001,  Weimer-
skirch et al. 1997, Weimerskirch 1998a). As in the case
with auks and cormorants, when areas are found to be
non-profitable,  birds  will  rapidly  move  away  to
another area before tracks become more meandering
again.  In  a  final  phase,  seabirds  return  rapidly  and

directly to the nest, with little deviation from a straight
line  course  (e.g.  Jouventin  et  al.  1994,  Bethge  et  al.
1997,  Bost  et  al.  1997).  A  consequence  of  this  behav-
iour  is  that  foraging  tracks  of  nesting  individuals  are
remarkably  similar,  even  across  groups,  although  the
scales may differ substantially. Jouventin et al. (1994)
recognised 2 primary types of foraging tracks in King
penguins,  distinguished  by  their  ellipticity:  ‘direct’
trips,  in  which  birds  moved  directly  to  one  spot,  for-
aged  and  then  returned  directly,  and  ‘circular’  trips,
in which birds executed a looping course with several
foraging stops. Similar patterns have been documented
for  many  seabird  species  (Heath  &  Randall  1989,
Weimerskirch 1998a), although behaviour varies sub-
stantially  both  inter-  and  intraspecifically  (e.g.  Wei-
merskirch  et  al.  1993,  Weimerskirch  1998a).  This  has
profound implications with respect to the area covered
by nesting birds and thus the utility of birds for moni-
toring  the  environment.  Where  birds  move  to  a  sin-
gle foraging  area,  in  doubling  back  on  their  tracks
they essentially re-cover previously travelled ground,
whereas any movement in elliptical courses increases
the  new  distance  covered,  with  the  more  circular
routes giving the most disparate spatial data.

In  projected  environmental  monitoring  studies,  the
utility of seabirds for covering extensive areas of ocean
is  enhanced  if  there  is  considerable  inter-  and  intra-
individual variation in foraging areas. In fact, seabirds
seem  to  show  virtually  all  possible  combinations  of
variability  and  invariability  (e.g.  Weimerskirch  et  al.
1993,  Ostrand  et  al.  1998).  There  are,  for  example,
species  in  which  individuals  apparently  repeatedly
return to the same site to forage, although the popula-
tion forages over a fairly disparate area, e.g. great cor-
morants (Grémillet et al. 1998). In other species, such
as the shy albatross around Tasmania, Australia, most
individuals forage at a single, relatively restricted site
(Brothers  et  al.  1998),  while  others,  such  as  the  wan-
dering  albatross,  forage  at  highly  variable  localities
(Weimerskirch  1998a).  In  addition,  many  Procellari-
iformes  alter  foraging  locations  according  to  body
condition;  they  tend  to  alternate  short  trips,  with
restricted  foraging  ranges,  with  longer  meandering
trips (Weimerskirch 1998b). Although spatial variabil-
ity in the species used is apparently an asset for envi-
ronmental  monitoring  studies,  species  which  may
move over, or through, particular sites at intervals can
be used to examine temporal trends in key variables.

Speed of area coverage

Although  most  birds  should  actually  travel  at  fairly
fixed  speeds  in  order  to  minimise  costs  of  transport
(Pinshow et al. 1977, Culik et al. 1994, Hedenström &

254

Mar Ecol Prog Ser 228: 241–261, 2002

Alerstam  1995),  the  perceived  speed  with  which  the
birds move over, or through, the ocean is dependent on
the  interval  over  which  the  speed  is  measured,
because the course taken becomes increasingly more
direct  as  the  measurement  interval  decreases  (e.g.
Hull  et  al.  1997,  Wilson  2001).  However,  even  over  a
period  of  some  hours,  seabirds  can  cover  astonishing
distances. King penguins have been recorded as trav-
elling at minimum mean speeds of 13 km h–1 over 6 h
or 8.5 km h–1 over 11 h (data obtained from fixes ob-
tained using satellite telemetry; C.-A.B. unpubl. data).
Among  the  volant  seabirds,  where  travelling  speeds
are  considerably  higher,  wandering  albatross  can
travel  over  1200  km  in  < 20  h  (data  from  PTTs;
Weimerskirch et al. 1993), a mean travelling speed of
60 km h–1. Even smaller species are capable of rapid,
long-distance  travel.  For  example,  a  white-chinned
petrel has been documented as having travelled from
South  Africa  to  the  Crozet  Archipelago,  southern
Indian Ocean, and back, a round trip of 3068 km, at an
average speed of 52.7 km h–1 (Catard & Weimerskirch
1999).

Although the distance covered per unit time gives a
measure  of  the  utility  of  various  seabird  species  for
studying environmental variables over different scales
of  time  and  space,  it  is  ultimately  the  specific  area
usage  that  is  of  primary  interest.  The  likelihood  that
this area will be large or distant from the breeding site
is dependent on a number of factors: the length of the
foraging trip, the travelling speed of the bird and the
economy of the energetics of the movement of the bird
in  question  (Pennycuick  1997).  The  area  covered  by
foraging seabirds lies between the ranges of terns and
some gulls, which generally forage within a few kilo-
metres of the breeding site (Pearson 1968, Becker et al.
1993, Garthe 1997) as is also often the case with pen-
guins (Wilson 1995), to those of the Procellariiformes,
which  may  regularly  range  many  hundreds  of  kilo-
metres  (Weimerskirch  1998b).  The  most  consistent
long-distance round-trip of 3500 km is made by white-
chinned petrels commuting from the Crozet Archipel-
ago  to  South  Africa  during  incubation  (Weimers-
kirch et al. 1999).

penguins  may  travel  at  least  1470  km  from  the
colonies  (PTT  data  from  Davis  et  al.  1996),  chinstrap
penguins  1600  km  (GLS  data  from  Wilson  et  al.
1998b) while even Antarctic gentoo penguins, consid-
ered  to  be  sedentary  (Croxall  &  Davis  1999),  range
further than during the breeding season by a factor of
2  (Wilson  et  al.  1998a).  To  our  knowledge,  the  only
comparable  data  on  area  utilisation  currently  avail-
able  for  Procellariiformes  were  derived  from  2  alba-
tross  species.  Black-browed  albatross  equipped  at
New  Island,  Falklands,  spend  significantly  less  time
flying  per  day  than  they  do  during  the  breeding
season  (37  and  52%  of  their  total  time,  respectively;
Grémillet  et  al.  2000),  and  have  a  mean  bird-colony
distance  of  680 km  (Grémillet  et  al.  2000).  Interest-
ingly, these birds apparently use the same rough geo-
graphic areas during both the breeding and the non-
breeding  season  (Grémillet  et  al.  2000).  A  recent
study on 4 wandering albatross showed that at least 1
bird  ranged  much  further  during  the  non-breeding
season than it would have during the breeding season
(Weimerskirch  &  Wilson  2000).  This  ties  in  well  with
what  is  believed  normal  for  most  Procellariiformes,
since  there  are  well-documented  cases  of  birds  ex-
ploiting  completely  different  areas  during  the  breed-
ing  and  non-breeding  seasons  (del  Hoyo  et  al.  1992
and references therein).

Overall, area coverage by non-breeding seabirds is
remarkably  global,  with  birds  ranging  many  thou-
sands  of  kilometres  into  remote  oceanic  areas.  This
can be illustrated by consideration of a single species
breeding in the southern oceans, the wandering alba-
tross. This species breeds at just 8 island sites, but the
non-breeding  range  extends  from  the  edge  of  ice
areas  almost  up  to  the  equator  in  all  of  the  world’s
major  oceans  (Fig.  8).  Clearly,  their  potential  for  re-
motely  monitoring  large  tracts  of  ocean  with  difficult
access  is  great  although  the  time  that  this  species
spends  in  areas  that  are  not  of  specific  interest  may
partly  negate  the  collection  of  useful  data  for  the
oceanographer.

Space utilisation during the non-breeding season

During  the  non-breeding  season,  seabirds  are
not constrained to return to their nesting sites and
can thus potentially range much further than they
can  during  breeding.  There  are,  however,  few
studies  that  can  verify  this  due  to  the  difficulties
inherent  in  equipping  seabirds  for  long  periods
(e.g. Wilson et al. 1998a, Prince et al. 1998). Data
from  penguins  show  that  overwintering  Adélie

Behavioural and morphological considerations for
effective measurement of environmental variables

Recovery of recording units

The  systems  presented  here  for  measuring  marine
environmental  variables  all  record,  rather  than  trans-
mit, data. As such, the devices have to be recovered in
order  to  access  data.  This  means  that  access  to  the
carrier has to be guaranteed subsequent to a period at
sea. The likelihood of device recovery varies consider-
ably,  being  highly  species-  and  locality-specific,  as
well as possibly being dependent on the wearing time
of the units. Difficulties in device recovery may be due
to  device-induced  changes  in  nest  absence  patterns
(e.g. Watanuki et al. 1992) or to nest or site desertion
(e.g.  Hatch  et  al.  2000).  Nest  desertion  and  site  infi-
delity occur even in non-equipped seabirds (e.g. Gas-
ton & Nettleship 1981), but manipulated animals may
be  even  more  intractable  (cf.  Wanless  et  al.  1985),
although specific data are often difficult to extract from
the  literature.  In  a  study  during  which  we  equipped
53 Magellanic  penguins  breeding  at  6  sites  in  the
southern Atlantic with logging units, we recovered 49
devices (92.5%) after a ca. 6 wk wearing period (R.W.
unpubl.  data).  Hatch  et  al.  (2000),  however,  caused
massive (but unspecified) nest desertion in auks fitted
with PTTs in a study in Alaska! Clearly, the percentage
recovery of deployed units will be a major determinant
in the viability and moral acceptability of studies of this
type (see below).

Contact with the water

In order to ensure effective measurement of environ-
mental variables, equipped seabirds have to have con-
tact with the water, and the most widely ranging spe-
cies  are  of  little  use  if  this  occurs  infrequently.  The
continued  miniaturisation  of  electronics  means  that
loggers  can  now  be  attached  to  the  legs  of  some
seabird  species  such  as  albatrosses  (Wilson  et  al.
1995c), so that birds only have to alight on the water to
effect  measurement  (Weimerskirch  et  al.  1995).  Few
studies have considered how often seabirds alight on
the water. However, breeding black-browed albatross
alight on the water a mean of once every 111 min, or 13
times d–1 (Grémillet et al. 2000). Wandering albatross
alight once every 53 min (SD = 12) (Weimerskirch et al.
1997) such that, if it is assumed that these birds travel
at speeds on the order of 15 m s–1 (Pennycuick 1982),
they  would  be  sampling  the  water  once  every  48  km
travelled. In other studies, stomach temperature analy-
sis indicates that equipped birds catch prey on average
once  every  3.6  to  4.4  h  but  alight  on  the  water  once

every  1.1  h  (Weimerskirch  &  Wilson  1992,  Weimers-
kirch  et  al.  1994,  1997).  This  suggests  that  prey  is
caught once every ca. 4 landings, indicating that not all
landing events need be directly associated with acqui-
sition of prey, i.e. prey distribution does not define the
positions that seabirds might choose to alight and thus
potentially sample the water. Limited analysis of data
from northern gannets Sula bassana indicate that these
birds  alight  once  every  32  min  (SD  =  42.9,  n  =  9  d,
3 birds) (S.G. unpubl. data).

Depth-dependent profiles

For  environmental  variables  to  be  measured  down
the  water  column,  the  equipped  birds  have  to  dive.
Ashmole  (1971)  classified  seabirds  according  to  their
foraging  habits  as  pursuit  divers,  plunge  divers,
surface  feeders  and  flight  feeders.  Neither  flight  nor
surface  feeders  are  of  any  use  for  measuring  depth-
dependent  variables.  Plunge  divers  (Table  4)  are  of
restricted use because they plunge into the water at a
high  speed  from  the  air,  traversing  the  upper  layers
extremely fast, but coming rapidly to a halt in a rather
shallow  dive  (e.g.  cape  gannet  Sula  capensis:  mean
dive depth 5.9 m, maximum 12.6 m; Adams & Walter
1993, cf. Le Corre 1997) during which time they have
been  underwater  for  relatively  short  periods  (e.g.
Schreiber  et  al.  1975,  Duffy  1983,  Garthe  et  al.  1999,
2000).  This  leaves  little  room  for  time-based  sensor
equilibration  and,  in  any  event,  necessitates  that  the
logger measure at extremely short intervals. A surpris-
ing  number  of  seabirds  habitually  dive  to  find  food
although  only  4  groups  regularly  reach  depths  in
excess  of  20  m,  these  being  the  shearwaters,  auks,
cormorants and penguins. There are records of the last
3 groups exceeding 100 m (Croxall et al. 1991, Croll et
al.  1992,  Wilson  1995),  and  Emperor  penguins  even
dive in excess of 500 m (Kooyman & Kooyman 1995).
The amount of time that divers actually spend under-
water  and,  therefore,  are  available  to  measure  envi-
ronmental variables is dependent on group. For exam-
ple, penguins may be below the surface for up to 90%
of the time at sea (Wilson & Wilson 1990), while great
cormorants spend ca. 20% of their time at sea under-
water (Grémillet 1997).

Bird size

The extent to which it is practicable and acceptable
to put devices on seabirds depends on the sizes of both.
Nominally, researchers work according to the 5% rule,
whereby the mass of the device should not exceed 5%
that of the bird (for discussion of this and other aspects

of  bird  equipment  see  Calvo  &  Furness  1992);  how-
ever, even quite small devices may affect seabird for-
aging  ecology,  especially  in  diving  species  in  which
hydrodynamic  concerns  become  important  (e.g.  Wil-
son  &  Culik  1992,  Hull  1997).  Seabirds  vary  in  size
from  about  25  g  for  a  storm  petrel  Hydrobatidae  to
36 kg  for  an  emperor  penguin  (Table  4).  While  the
larger species are likely to be least affected by device
attachment,  no  seabird  is  globally  distributed  so  the
species to be used will depend on the area under con-
sideration and bird distributional data as well as size.
There  is  an  important  moral  issue  to  be  addressed
when  using  seabirds  to  monitor  the  marine  environ-
ment.  To  what  extent  can  deleterious  effects  on  the
carrier animal be considered acceptable? There are 3
well-defined  views  on  this  question.  One  is  that  the
well-being  of  the  animal  is  irrelevant  provided  that
data  on  position,  time  and  the  variable  to  be  studied
can be obtained. In such cases the biological meaning
of the movement of the carrier is ignored. We believe
this  approach  to  be  morally  unacceptable.  A  second
level  is  to  consider  that  the  equipped  animal  should
behave ‘normally’ and thus demonstrate some reason-

able state of well-being. It is within this framework that
most  seabird  researchers  work,  although  there  are
obvious control problems associated with determining
and defining ‘normal’ behaviour. A third level, seldom
realised, is that the animal shows no apparent reaction
at  all  to  emplacement  of  the  device.  This  situation
would be ideal and, were it easily achieved, could even
make  a  case  for  the  study  of  marine  environmental
variables irrespective of consideration of the biology of
the bird in question. It is to be hoped that the constant
improvements  being  made  in  solid  state  technology
will  enable  us  to  achieve  the  third  level  in  future
studies.  For  the  present,  however,  researchers  must
work in a morally grey area where their drive to obtain
new data must be, or should be, tempered by the ethics
of  bird  exploitation.  To  safeguard  the  welfare  of  sea-
birds we suggest that no measurement of environmen-
tal  variables  using  seabirds  should  take  place  unless
those variables are directly considered with respect to
the movement or behaviour of the equipped animals.
This rule would act as a policing policy to ensure that
the  well-being  of  the  seabird  is  of  primary  concern.
Having  implemented  this,  however,  the  simple  fact

Wilson et al.: Monitoring the oceans using seabirds

257

that  seabirds  are  strongly  selected  to  exploit  the
marine  environment  as  efficiently  as  possible,  might
lead us to expect that these remarkable animals have a
great deal to tell us about an environment with which
we are not really familiar.

CONCLUSIONS

Seabirds  are  fast-moving,  wide-ranging,  highly
efficient  top  predators  of  oceanic  ecosystems  that
exploit the upper layers of the water column. They are
potentially  excellent  carriers  of  sophisticated  remote-
sensing  equipment  from  which  bird  positional  infor-
mation  and data on the physical characteristics of the
marine environment can be calculated. The precision
with which bird position can be determined currently
varies  between  about  150  m  and  100  km,  and  posi-
tional fixes can be taken over time scales ranging from
seconds to days, being highly dependent on the system
used. This situation will change dramatically as soon as
GPS units are small enough to be deployed on seabirds
so  that  positions  can  be  determined  to  within  a  few
metres and updated every second if the bird is at the
surface.  To  date,  temperature  and  light  are  the  only
environmental parameters which have been monitored
via seabirds, although, given current advances in solid
state  technology,  this  situation  is  likely  to  change
within the next few years to include salinity. The reac-
tion  time  of  the  sensor  used  is  critically  important  in
considerations  of  its  utility  in  such  studies.  Currently
no  commercially  available  temperature  sensor  reacts
fast  enough  to  be  able  to  measure  temperature  as  a
function  of  depth  in  diving  seabirds.  Despite  their
qualities  for  use  in  environmental  monitoring  the
ethics  of  using  seabirds  necessitates  that  their  well-
being be a primary consideration in studies of this ilk.
To ensure that this be the case, we suggest that all such
research efforts focus primarily on understanding the
normal  movements  of  the  birds.  This  approach  will
tend  to  protect  the  animals  from  career-driven  data
acquisition at any cost and allow researchers to iden-
tify regions of the world’s oceans that are considered
by the birds themselves to be worthy of study.
