Abstract
Satellite transmitters that provide Doppler-based locations and telemeter data via the Argos satellite system have revealed a wealth of
information on the movement ecology of di ver se fauna such as marine mammals, turtles, and sharks. In contrast, satellite telemetry
studies of bony fishes have almost exclusively relied on pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs) that use light-based geolocation to
estimate movements. However, track reconstructions based on light and other sensor data transmitted by PSATs exhibit positional
error that is orders of magnitude higher than those from Argos Doppler-based locations, effectively limiting our understanding of bony
fish movement ecology to coarse scales. Although PSATs continue to be the technological workhorse of billfish research, with more
than 10 0 0 data records published to date, a handful of pioneering studies have tried using tags capable of providing Argos Doppler-
based locations to better understand these taxa. We assess the applicability of Argos satellite transmitters to study billfish in the context
of their depth distribution and by comparing alternative tag attachment strategies and form factors. We present two case studies that
highlight how these data can explicitly be used for fine-scale ecological and oceanographic research. This work culminates with the
introduction of a new Smart Position and Temperature (SPOT) transmitting tag designed specifically for billfish and other pelagic fishes
that has the potential to open new avenues of research, revealing dimensions of behavior that previously could not be in vestig ated.

Introduction

Satellite telemetry is a critical part of the ecologist’s toolkit, es-
pecially in the marine environment where animal movements
across vast areas of the open ocean are observable with these
technologies (Hussey et al. 2015 , Harcourt et al. 2019 ). These
animal-borne devices may take the form of (1) pop-up satel-
lite archival tags (PSATs), which typically archive a time se-
ries of depth, temperature, and light level that is summarized
and transmitted after the completion of a deployment and is
used to estimate the movement path of the animal, or (2) Ar-
gos satellite transmitters, which transmit while attached to the
animal to provide location data in near-real time by calculat-
ing locations from the Doppler shift of the satellite transmis-
sions. While there is widespread use of Argos satellite trans-
mitters on fauna such as marine mammals (McIntyre 2014 ),
turtles (Hays and Hawkes 2018 ), and sharks (Renshaw et al.
2023 ), satellite telemetry studies of bony fishes almost exclu-
sively rely on PSATs. This faunal disparity in the use of these
technologies primarily stems from the functional requirement
that Argos satellite transmitters break the surface of the wa-
ter to send transmissions to overhead satellites, which occurs
frequently for air-breathing species but is less predictable for
fishes that extract oxygen from the water. The resulting near-
real time positions from such transmitters, whether leveraging
Doppler-shift of satellites in the Argos network or transmit-
ting other accurate location information such as snapshots of
the GPS constellation, are typically two to three orders of mag-
nitude more accurate (Douglas et al. 2012 , Dujon et al. 2014 )

than those derived from model-based geolocation of archival
tag data (Teo et al. 2004 , Winship et al. 2012 , Braun et al.
2015 , 2018 ). As a result, the movement ecology of marine an-
imals studied with Argos satellite transmitters is well-known
from coarse (e.g. Lea et al. 2015 ) to fine (e.g. Della Penna et al.
2015 ) scales, whereas that of wide-ranging bony fishes is often
limited to coarser scales matching the high positional uncer-
tainty inherent in movements estimated from archival tag data
(Gatti et al. 2021 ).

More than 1000 PSATs have been deployed on billfishes
globally (Braun et al. 2015 ), and these tags continue to be
the technological workhorse of the field (e.g. Rohner et al.
2022 , Andrzejaczek et al. 2023 , Malara et al. 2024 ). How-
ever, a handful of pioneering studies have identified the po-
tential of Argos satellite transmitters for better understanding
these taxa. To date, there are only six published studies lever-
aging Argos technology on billfishes, representing ecological,
anatomical, and body size gradients from spearfish (Arostegui
et al. 2024b ) to marlin (Holdsworth et al. 2009 , Sippel et al.
2011 ) and swordfish (Evans et al. 2011 , Braun et al. 2019a ,
Sepulveda et al. 2020 ), as well as variation in tag form fac-
tors and attachment methods informing their relative perfor-
mance. In each of the studies that tested the applicability of
such technology to billfish, Argos satellite transmitters were
primarily used for investigating regional connectivity and mi-
gration routes, often in the context of informing stock delin-
eation and future assessment. Thus, while some of these stud-
ies mention the potential for high-resolution positional data

to enable ecological inquiry at finer scales (e.g. Evans et al.
2011 ), they largely did not leverage these data to demonstrate
this capacity. Here, we assess the applicability of Argos satel-
lite transmitters to billfish research, present case studies on
how these data can explicitly be used for fine-scale ecological
applications, and introduce a new Smart Position and Temper-
ature (SPOT) transmitting tag designed specifically for billfish
and other pelagic fishes.

Applicability of Argos satellite transmitters to
tr ac king billfish
Surface occupation
The viability of studying billfish with Argos satellite transmit-
ters is dependent on their occupation of surface waters, which
varies among species. Billfishes are primarily epipelagic, with
the notable exception of swordfish ( Xiphias gladius ) that al-
most exclusively occupy mesopelagic waters > 200 m during
the daytime (Madigan et al. 2020 , Braun et al. 2023 ). Fur-
thermore, all species exhibit diel differences in depth distribu-
tion that typically consist of shallower nighttime than daytime
occupancy (e.g. Blondin et al. 2023 ), although the opposite
is uniquely characteristic of shortbill spearfish ( Tetrapturus
angustirostris—Arostegui et al. 2019b , 2024b ). Even when the
larger-bodied billfishes that usually remain in the top 100 m,
such as blue marlin, repeatedly foray into mesopelagic depths,
their deep movements are interspersed with ascents into sur-
face waters to thermoregulate and/or repay oxygen debts (An-
drzejaczek et al. 2023 ). Averaging across published studies, the
mean overall proportion of time spent in the upper 5 or 10 m
of the water column exceeds 40% for nearly all billfishes, with
black marlin ( Istiompax indica ) exhibiting the lowest surface
occupancy of the primarily epipelagic billfishes and swordfish
exhibiting the lowest overall ( Fig. 1 ). This proxy indicates how
often an Argos satellite transmitter might reach the surface to
communicate with satellites and highlights that this technol-
ogy can be applied to all billfishes regardless of their ecological
differences.

While surface occupancy differs among billfishes, there is
also notable intraspecific variability ( Fig. 1 ) that is driven, in
part, by the oceanographic environment. The extent of bill-
fish vertical movements is limited by the abiotic environment
in the form of temperature and oxygen (Braun et al. 2015 ).
For example, epipelagic billfishes experience vertical habitat
compression in areas where cold and/or hypoxic waters oc-
cur closer to the surface, such as in upwelling regions (Prince
and Goodyear 2006 , Prince et al. 2010 , Carlisle et al. 2017 ,
Logan et al. 2023b ), basins with substantial oxygen minimum
zones (Stramma et al. 2012 ), and cold-core eddies (Arostegui
et al. 2019a ) that restrict animals to the uppermost portion of
the water column. Similarly, in cooler water masses, swordfish
more frequently engage in daytime basking behavior (Dewar
et al. 2011 ), a marked deviation from their typical pattern of
diel vertical migration in which they briefly return to the sur-
face to rewarm before descending back to mesopelagic depths
(Stoehr et al. 2018 ). For example, the mean overall proportion
of time swordfish spent in the top 10 m was two times greater
in the Southeast Pacific (Abascal et al. 2010 ) than Northwest
Atlantic (Braun et al. 2019a ), where the animals occupied wa-
◦C for > 50% and < 20% of the daytime, respectively.
ters ≤10
This issue of variable surface occupation and, thus, poten-
tial for acquiring satellite-based locations is also evident in

Figure 1. Surface habitat use. Near-surface occupancy (0–5 and 0–10 m)

ocean sunfishes ( Mola spp.), one of the only other groups of
teleosts with which Argos satellite transmitters have been used
to track movements (Sims et al. 2009 , Thys et al. 2015 , 2017 ,
Sousa et al. 2016 , Nyegaard et al. 2023 ). Ocean sunfishes are
well-known throughout much of their range for frequently
basking at the surface between deep dives (Nakamura et al.
2015 ); however, in particularly warm seas, these animals ap-
pear to recover from cold and/or low oxygen exposure in the
warm mixed layer rather than at the surface, yielding infre-
quent Argos- and GPS-based locations (Nyegaard et al. 2023 ).
Billfish surface occupancy may also vary with ontogeny in
some species (Braun et al. 2015 ) as larger fish occupy pro-
gressively deeper waters. As fish increase in size (i.e. body
mass), they achieve greater thermal inertia that reduces the
rate of conductive heat loss from the animal to its surround-
ing  environment  (Nakamura  et  al.  2020 ).  Similarly,  many
pelagic fishes also gain more advanced physiological capac-
ities, such as increasingly effective vascular counter-current
heat exchangers that reduce the rate of convective heat loss
at the gills (e.g. Dickson et al. 2000 ). Combined, these onto-
genetic changes manifest as greater dive duration and reduced

ployment duration of 25 days (i.e. time from tagging to final
transmitted location) and 2.3 positions per day. These short
deployments were characterized by high data quality but were
seemingly limited by hydrodynamic stress on the tags induced
by tailbeats. While transition toward a more flexible antenna
capable of reversible deformation appeared to improve per-
formance, the caudal fin is inherently a high-stress position
that is subject to massive acceleration and deceleration cycles
that can rapidly induce attachment failure (Holdsworth et al.
2009 ). Among billfishes, only swordfish have a rigid dorsal
fin akin to that of sharks that is suitable for fixed tag ap-
plications (Holland et al. 2022 ). This alternative mounting
approach was tested on swordfish with Argos satellite trans-
mitters (SPOT-258 or SPOT-380, Wildlife Computers—Fig. 2 )
bolted to the anterior edge of the dorsal fin and yielded an av-
erage deployment duration and positions per day of 278 days
and 0.2 locations per day in the Northeast Pacific ( n = 6;
Sepulveda et al. 2020 ) and 148 days and 0.4 locations per
day in the Western Central Atlantic ( n = 3; Braun, Gaube,
Thorrold—unpublished data). While location data were tem-
porally patchy due to the characteristically low use of surface
waters by swordfish, continued transmission for more than a
year in some instances proves that dorsal fin mounting is a
robust attachment method for long-term deployments on this
species.

Towed  tags  are  positively  buoyant  to  facilitate  above-
surface transmission and are typically tethered to an intra-
muscular  anchor  (Thys  et  al.  2015 )  or,  less  often,  a  non-
invasive harness (Fontes et al. 2022 ). Towed tags come in a
range of sizes and form factors that aim to optimize the trade-
off between minimizing drag and maximizing buoyancy (to
facilitate satellite transmission at the surface). For example,
prototype tags that incorporated GPS receivers (MK10-PAT-
F, Wildlife Computers—Fig. 2 ) were used to study swordfish
( n = 10) in the Tasman Sea and largely achieved the pro-
grammed 60-day deployment durations, resulting in GPS po-
sitions for an average of 10.6% (range: 0%–33.3%) of each
deployment (Evans et al. 2011 ). In contrast, while these same
towed tags used on swordfish ( n = 3) in the Northwest At-
lantic lasted up to their programmed 180-day deployment du-
ration, only one yielded any positions (Braun et al. 2019a ).
The ability of this tag to acquire locations stemmed, at least
in part, from its “boat-like” design that helped to minimize
roll (i.e. lateral rotation that would take the antennae off the
vertical axis) and maintain a stable, upright orientation of
the antenna while at rest or under tow (Evans et al. 2011 ).
While Fastloc GPS technology requires only one brief surfac-
ing to achieve a GPS snapshot, which can yield greater loca-
tion data coverage at higher resolution (e.g. Kuhn et al. 2009 ,
Thomson et al. 2017 , Nyegaard et al. 2023 ), GPS-capable tags
that can be applied to fishes are larger and incur more drag
that may not be suitable for small-bodied study species. These
smaller species necessitate minimizing drag to avoid impact-
ing the animals and to facilitate extended deployments. For
example, a recent study used a prototype towed tag (SPOT-
376c, Wildlife Computers—Fig. 2 ) to track shortbill spearfish
( n = 8) in the Central North Pacific (Arostegui et al. 2024b ).
These tags yielded mixed outcomes with deployment dura-
tions of 7–185 days and Argos-based positions covering an
average 22.6% (range: 1.3%–62.2%) of each fish’s deploy-
ment duration. These same tags outfitted on juvenile sword-
fish ( n = 2, ≤ 141 cm lower jaw fork length) in the Western
Central Atlantic yielded a similarly diverse performance with

frequency of thermoregulatory ascents into the mixed layer
(e.g. Hino et al. 2021 ). Larger size classes of black marlin and
swordfish, in particular, are documented as increasing their
time spent at depth, which is consistent with increased ther-
mal inertia (Williams et al. 2017 ) and/or physiological capac-
ity (Braun et al. 2019a ) enabling greater cold tolerance.

Tag attachment and form factor
While the species, oceanographic conditions, and animal size
class jointly affect the potential for an Argos satellite trans-
mitter to yield location data, realized performance is also sig-
nificantly impacted by the tag attachment and form factor.
These tag-related details all varied among the pioneering bill-
fish studies, providing valuable insight for tag selection in the
design of future studies. Argos satellite transmitters can be
broadly separated into two major groups based on attachment
method: (1) fixed and (2) towed ( Fig. 2 ).

Fixed tags are directly secured to animal hard parts that
break the surface of the water by, for instance, glueing to
the shell of a sea turtle (Hays and Hawkes 2018 ) or bolt-
ing to the dorsal fin of a shark (Heim et al. 2022 ). The only
hard part present among all billfishes that is potentially suit-
able for attachment is the rigid caudal fin. The first satellite-
transmitter study iterated a caudal mounting method to track
striped marlin ( Kajikia audax , n = 26) in the Southwest Pacific
(Holdsworth et al. 2009 ). Argos satellite transmitters (SPOT
4.0 or SPOT 5.0, Wildlife Computers—Fig. 2 ) were stapled or
bolted to the upper lobe of the caudal fin and further secured
via plates or a sleeve. This approach yielded an average de-

deployment durations of 15–114 days and Argos-based po-
sitions covering an average 31.5% (range: 20.0%–43.0%) of
each fish’s deployment duration (Braun, Gaube, Thorrold—
unpublished data). The SPOT tag used in these small billfish
examples was one-third the weight of the GPS-based model
from the study of larger-bodied swordfish (Evans et al. 2011 )
and is markedly smaller in profile than any previous towed
tag. However, the observed variability in performance likely
stems from the tether attachment point on the tag being op-
posite of the antenna, causing the tag to pitch horizontally
while under tow and presumably precluding the antenna and
wet/dry switch from breaking the surface-air interface except
during periods of almost no active swimming at the water’s
surface. Thus, for ram-ventilating billfishes that must swim
constantly to breathe (Wegner et al. 2010 ), transmission is
possible from a tag with this form factor only if the study
animal is moving at a slow speed so that the tag antenna can
achieve a sufficiently upright position.

Geolocation impro v ement

Reconstruction of movement patterns is among the most ubiq-
uitous analyses in satellite telemetry studies of billfish and
other highly migratory fishes and is central to the ecological
inferences gleaned from such research efforts. Geolocation of
pelagic fishes outfitted with PSATs typically depends on light
level and sea surface temperature (SST), both of which require
frequent near-surface occupation by the study species (Gatti et
al. 2021 ). While most pelagic fishes satisfy this condition, best-
case PSAT track reconstructions are limited to ∼100 km of po-
sitional error due to underlying calculations using light to de-
rive geographic position (Hill and Braun 2001 , Teo et al. 2004 ,
Winship et al. 2012 ). However, a number of species-specific

characteristics (e.g. deep diving) and technological issues (e.g.
poor data transmission) can lead to challenging datasets for
geolocation (Nyegaard et al. 2023 ). As the volume of trans-
mitted archival data decreases, reconstructed movement paths
become poorly constrained, leading to increased positional er-
ror (Braun et al. 2018 ) and, in some cases, an inability to
constrain geolocation estimates (Horton et al. 2024 ). Accu-
rate location data from Argos satellite transmitters can be
used to confront the uncertainty inherent in geolocation es-
timates, as they are effectively “known” locations that can be
leveraged as anchor points throughout a track (Arostegui et
al. 2024a ). Known locations help to reduce error on the days
with Argos- or GPS-based location data as well as the prop-
agation of error through time on temporally adjacent days,
making them extremely valuable in improving the accuracy
of track reconstructions (Arostegui et al. 2024a ). Integrating
Argos- or GPS-based locations with PSAT data in track re-
construction is easily achieved in the current generation of
geolocation models, such as Global Position Estimator 3 (ex-
clusive to users of Wildlife Computers tags) and HMMoce
(open access at: https:// github.com/ camrinbraun/ HMMoce —
Braun et al. 2018 ). This form of data integration has been
used in double-tagging studies (e.g. PSAT + SPOT applied
to  striped  marlin, Sippel  et  al. 2011 )  and  in  studies  using
tags with dual archival and Argos satellite transmitting ca-
pabilities (Nyegaard et al. 2023 ). While there is added ex-
pense  to  acquire  archival  sensor  and  high-resolution  loca-
tion data in tandem from a given animal, the reduced un-
certainty of the spatial utilization distributions they can pro-
vide is better suited to addressing pressing questions in ba-
sic and applied ocean science (Sippel et al. 2015 , Arostegui
et al. 2024a )—especially for species like swordfish that typi-
cally yield less of the traditional data inputs for geolocation
( Fig. 3 ).

Argos satellite transmitters enable billfish research at finer scales

Case studies on the use of Argos satellite
tr ansmitt ers

To demonstrate the ability of Argos satellite transmitters to
open new avenues of billfish research, we present two case
studies that leverage high-resolution location data to demon-
strate  fine-scale  ecological  research  applications. There  are
few precedents in the pelagic teleost literature for studying
movements and behavior at these scales but ample represen-
tatives in studies of other marine taxa for which using Argos
satellite technology is common.

Current-oriented swimming
In satellite tracking of large marine predators, the observed
velocity (i.e. displacement rate) and trajectory have long been
assumed to solely be the result of directed swimming, as the
influence of water movement is typically thought to be neg-
ligible for animals that can swim faster than the prevailing
current (Della Penna et al. 2015 ). Yet, the velocity of the wa-
ter in which animals are travelling can dramatically influence
their net displacement and direction (Fossette et al. 2012 ). No-
tably, for sea turtles, disentangling the contributions of active
swimming versus current drift is critical to accurately ana-
lyzing their movement ecology (Gaspar et al. 2006 ), which
has enabled substantial advances in the understanding of their
navigation and migratory behavior in the open ocean (e.g. Put-
man and Mansfield 2015 , Gaube et al. 2017 , Hays et al. 2020 ).
Additionally, recent studies focused on the role of current in
marine ecology demonstrate that it is not just smaller ani-
mals with lower movement capacity, such as jellyfishes, that
can detect water flow and alter their behavior in response
to the prevailing conditions (Fossette et al. 2015 ), but also
marine megafauna. For example, southern elephant seals ex-
hibit bouts of horizontal drift when occupying fronts, enabling
them to transition their energy expenditure from horizontal
displacement to diving and foraging in the vertical dimen-
sion (Della Penna et al. 2015 ). There are myriad strategies
marine animals use to orient to current, such as taking ad-
vantage of favorable flows and compensating for opposing
ones, but knowledge of these processes is poorest for fishes
in the open ocean because the spatial and temporal resolution
of PSAT tracks is insufficient (Chapman et al. 2011 ). Similarly,
although active tracking of fishes (in which a boat is used to
follow an individual equipped with an acoustic tag) can pro-
vide sufficient spatial resolution, this method yields deploy-
ments generally < 48 h in duration that occur in the immedi-
ate, post-release period (Brill et al. 1993 , Pepperell and Davis
1999 ) when these animals display recovery behavior (Logan et
al. 2022 ). Notably, billfish outfitted with Argos satellite trans-
mitters typically do not yield transmissions for at least the first
few days post-release (Holdsworth et al. 2009 ), after which
extended fine-scale tracking of these animals with this technol-
ogy has the potential to reveal natural behavioral responses to
prevailing flow conditions. This knowledge gap on fish inter-
actions with flows in the open ocean clashes with the critical
influence ocean currents exert on nearly every aspect of ocean
ecology (Hays 2017 ), highlighting why this is currently a key
question in megafauna movement ecology (Hays et al. 2016 ).
Here, we assess the potential for current-oriented swim-
ming  by  billfish  using  a  towed  Argos  satellite  transmit-
ter (SPO T-376c, Wildlife Computers—Fig. 2 ) deployed on a
shortbill spearfish for 119 days in the waters around the Main
Hawaiian Islands ( Fig. 4 a). The track of this deployment—

originally leveraged as part of a study on the species’ large-
scale movement patterns (Arostegui et al. 2024b )—was built
with a state-space model that accounts for the varying levels
of error associated with the different Argos location quality
classes, yielding regularized locations every 24 h from tem-
porally irregular data (aniMotum, Jonsen et al. 2023 ). There
were, in particular, two periods of 23 and 53 days with nearly
uninterrupted daily Argos locations that are ideal for fine-
scale ecological inquiry, during which there was a median of
two Argos locations per day used as input to the state-space
model. We collocated the resulting sections of the spearfish
track to the Ocean Surface Current Analyses Real-time (OS-
CAR) database (Bonjean and Lagerloef 2002 , ESR and Dohan
2021 ), which provides the daily zonal and meridional veloci-
ties of current averaged over the top 30 m of the water column
at 0.25 × 0.25 degree resolution. Following the methodologi-
cal standard (Fossette et al. 2012 ), the active swimming veloc-
ity of the spearfish was calculated daily as the vector difference
between the observed and current velocities, and velocity vec-
tors were used to calculate heading. A two-dimensional gener-
alized additive model (Carslaw and Ropkins 2012 ) predicting
active swimming velocity as a function of current velocity and
the fish’s heading relative to that of the current was fit to the
combined tracking and oceanographic data to understand if
and how the spearfish changed its behavior in response to the
ambient flow environment.

By quantifying active swimming of the spearfish within the
variable frame of reference presented by dynamic open ocean
flows, our results suggest a diversity of current-oriented swim-
ming strategies. The observed velocities and headings of the
spearfish were better predicted by active swimming (correla-
tion: velocity, r = 0.79 | heading, r = 0.78) than surface cur-
rent (correlation: velocity, r = 0.16 | heading, r = 0.16), con-
sistent with the highly mobile nature of billfish. Furthermore,
the spearfish appeared to alter its swimming behavior in re-
sponse to variability in the flow environment ( Fig. 4 b). At low
current velocities, and regardless of current heading, spearfish
exhibited an intermediate mean active swimming speed. How-
ever, at high current velocities, the spearfish appeared to re-
spond more strongly to the ambient flow field. When swim-
ming along the same heading as the current, spearfish swim-
ming velocity decreased as current velocity increased. In con-
trast, when swimming opposite to the heading of the current,
spearfish swimming velocity increased as the current velocity
increased. This finding suggests that the tagged spearfish not
only detected current but could also distinguish when it was
in favorable flows (and reduced its active swimming to save
energy) or opposing flows (and increased its active swimming
to achieve travel distance that would otherwise be curtailed).
The open ocean is characterized by an absence of visual
cues for orientation. Fishes are thought to rely on their lat-
eral line to provide hydrodynamic sensory information and
subsequently alter their swimming behavior relative to the
prevailing flow conditions (Liao 2007 ). Movements of highly
mobile species often occur in dynamic seascapes where indi-
viduals engage in cost-effective movement to maximize en-
ergy surplus (e.g. Shepard et al. 2013 , Arostegui et al. 2023 ).
Future studies on billfishes should strive for increased quan-
tities of high-resolution data to rigorously assess the influ-
ence of current heading and velocity on active swimming and
whether these microscale swimming dynamics (e.g. Fig. 4 c)
structure migration routes at the macroscale ( sensu Goto et al.
2024 ).

difference between the headings of the fish and current, where 0 ◦, 90 ◦, and 180 ◦ represent swimming with, perpendicular to, and against the current,
respectively. (c) Example daily vector field of surface current with the spearfish’s collocated position (red point) and preceding 5 days of locations (red

In  addition  to  current-oriented  swimming,  the  location
data  from  the  SPOT  tag  revealed  that,  during  its  south-
ward displacement from the Island of Hawai`i, the spearfish
occupied  the  waters  proximal  to  a  previously  unnamed
pair  of  seamounts  ∼45  km  x  24  km  in  size  that  rise
from  > 5000  m  depth  to  summits  of  < 3800  m  ( Fig. 4 a).
Given  that  these  seamounts  are  located  at  the  Exclusive
Economic  Zone  boundary  of  the  Main  Hawaiian  Islands
(cid:6)(cid:6) W), a proposal to name them
(15
the “Hebi Seamounts” was submitted, recommended by the
Advisory Committee on Undersea Features, and approved by
the U.S. Board on Geographic Names (Unique Feature Iden-
tifier: 15570926). The chosen name “Hebi” is used locally in
Hawai`i for the shortbill spearfish. While geolocation of PSAT
data with ∼100 km error would have been unable to resolve

the occurrence of the spearfish near this fine-scale undersea
feature, the Argos satellite transmitter was capable of discern-
ing its brief occurrence in the area.

Association with submesoscale fronts and eddies
Submesoscale fronts and eddies occurring on spatial scales of
order 1–10 km are readily observable in satellite images of
ocean color or SST. These ephemeral features structure the
ocean environment and are increasingly understood to play an
important role across multiple trophic levels of pelagic ecosys-
tems (Lévy et al. 2018 ). A growing body of literature on vari-
ous pelagic predators, including seabirds (Tew Kai et al. 2009 ,
Lowther et al. 2014 ), seals (Nordstrom et al. 2013 , Siegel-
man et al. 2019 ), and whales (Cotte et al. 2011 , Fahlbusch

Argos satellite transmitters enable billfish research at finer scales

et al. 2024 ), highlights their affiliation to these features, pre-
sumably due to enhanced foraging opportunities. However,
observing pelagic teleosts at the fine resolution needed to dis-
cern patterns of association with submesoscale fronts and ed-
dies is challenging, resulting in almost no documentation of
such behavior for these taxa (but see Snyder et al. 2017 ). A
diverse community of fishes appears to be attracted to these
features, as some commercial fisheries are known to selec-
tively target fronts (Watson et al. 2018 ) and thereby increase
bycatch risk to aggregated marine megafauna (Scales et al.
2018 ). While  billfishes  are  known  to  preferentially  occupy
some mesoscale (order 10–100 km) features (Arostegui et al.
2022 ), researchers have yet to document submesoscale asso-
ciations despite the affiliation of billfishes to these small-scale
fronts being common knowledge among fishers. This dispar-
ity precludes informed conservation intervention in dynamic
ocean regions with consistent submesoscale activity that may
attract pelagic fishes and increase their exposure to anthro-
pogenic impact (Scales et al. 2014 ).

Here, we demonstrate billfish association to submesoscale
fronts and eddies using a towed Argos satellite transmitter
(SPO T-253, Wildlife Computers—Fig. 2 ) deployed on a sail-
fish  ( Istiophorus  platypterus )  for  70  days  in  the  Red  Sea
( Fig. 5 a). This individual was outfitted with a towed tag typ-
ified by a large, torpedo-like body and stabilizing fins that
was originally designed for large-bodied elasmobranchs (e.g.
whale shark—Hoffmayer et al. 2021 ). The reconstructed track
used Argos location data and a fitted state-space model (Jon-
sen et al. 2023 ) to produce predicted locations at 3-h res-
olution. This unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution
for a billfish track was enabled by the exceptional 87.3% of
days with location data, during which there was a median
of 7 Argos locations per day used as input to the tracking
model. (Sub)mesoscale variability present in the region during
the deployment was visualized with chlorophyll-a data from
the Ocean and Land Colour Imager (OLCI) onboard the Eu-
ropean Space Agency Sentinel-3A satellite. To quantify if the
tagged sailfish targeted submesoscale fronts and eddies, we
simulated 1000 tracks within the Red Sea that started and
ended in the same location as the real track, occurred over
the same time period, and based the simulated movement pa-
rameters on the best-fit parameters from the state-space model
of the real deployment. Both the real and simulated tracks
were collocated to backward-in-time finite size Lyapunov ex-
ponents (FSLEs) from AVISO (d’Ovidio et al. 2004 ), which
represent coherent Lagrangian convergent structures, includ-
ing (sub)mesocale fronts and the perimeters of eddies at daily,
0.04 degree resolution. The distribution of FSLEs occupied by
the tagged sailfish was compared to those of the simulations
to assess the potential selection for convergent features.

Our results suggest the sailfish targeted submesoscale fronts
and eddies as indicated both by qualitative comparison to re-
motely sensed chlorophyll-a and by quantifying the distribu-
tion of FSLEs occupied by the real versus simulated sailfish. A
single high-quality chlorophyll-a image acquired on 28 Jan-
uary 2020 reveals that the scales of movement of the fish are
similar to the meso- and submesoscale variability co-occurring
in the region ( Fig. 5 a and b). Detailed analysis of the loca-
tion of the fish on the day before and after the image indi-
cates a number of Argos locations were retrieved within a
submesoscale eddy ( Fig. 5 b). The individual locations in the
eddy were the only satellite uplinks received during the three
days bracketing the time of image acquisition, indicating a

potential behavioral change in response to interaction with
the low-chlorophyll submesoscale eddy.

Placing this detailed look at an individual day into the con-
text of the whole deployment, the along-track FSLEs of the
sailfish ( Fig. 5 c) were characterized by a primary peak at val-
−1 (representing less convergent waters)
ues larger than −0 .1 s
and a secondary peak at more negative FSLEs of −0 .475 to
−1  (representing more convergent waters), the lat-
−0 .375 s
ter of which was not exhibited by the simulated tracks. The
distribution of FSLEs was significantly different (more nega-
tive) in the observed track compared to the simulated ones
(permutation test, P = 0 .014). These results indicate that the
sailfish transited minimally dynamic waters, which were per-
vasive  during  the  deployment, to  selectively  associate  with
(sub)mesoscale features in regions of the Red Sea where the in-
teraction of currents generated ocean fronts. High-resolution
location data from Argos satellite transmitters is, therefore,
sufficient to resolve individual interactions with meso- and
submesoscale features, as has been done in other taxa (e.g.
sharks—Braun et al. 2019b , seabirds—Tew Kai et al. 2009 ,
marine mammals—Cotte et al. 2011 ), highlighting the scien-
tific potential of this technology in a tag designed specifically
for billfish.

New t ec hnolog y designed f or billfish and
other pelagic fishes

While the preceding case studies highlight the potential for
Argos satellite tags to revolutionize our understanding of the
movement ecology of billfish and other pelagic fishes, more
widespread use of this technology on these species has been
precluded by the lack of tools purpose-built for these animals.
Here, we introduce a new towed tag, the Wildlife Computers
SPO T-413 ( Fig. 2 ), which was collaboratively developed by
the authors of this paper to study billfish movements at high
spatial and temporal resolution.

For towed tags to be suitable for the smallest of the ram-
ventilating billfishes, they must have minimum drag and pos-
itive buoyancy to float toward the surface and allow trans-
missions when the fish swims near the air–water interface.
Wildlife Computers has produced the SPOT-253 for decades
( Fig. 2 ). It provides successful transmissions for animals trav-
eling close to the surface (e.g. Hoffmayer et al. 2021 ) but
was originally designed with greater buoyancy (and resultant
larger size and higher drag) to maximize surface transmissions
and accommodate steel cable tethers for deployments on large
elasmobranchs with abrasive skin. Thus, our goal was to re-
calibrate the design parameters for billfish to develop a new
towed tag with significantly lower drag force while maintain-
ing comparable transmission performance.

To validate the design of the new SPOT-413, testing was
performed using the Alice C. Tyler Flume at the University
of Washington Applied Physics Laboratory. Drag forces were
measured at the surface and while fully submerged, and trans-
mission performance was evaluated at a range of water speeds.
The size of the flume permitted use of an ∼120 cm tether
comprised of 100 lb monofilament. Flow speeds were lim-
−1 —consistent with
ited to the tank’s range of 0.5–1.2 m s
cruising speeds of billfish (e.g. Logan et al. 2023a ). Thus, tri-
als were able to represent ecologically appropriate, side-by-
side comparisons between the SPOT-253 and the prototype
SPOT-413. Initial tests on a prototype shape akin to the SPOT-
376c ( Fig. 2 ) confirmed that preliminary calculations were

correct in identifying the requisite amount of float material
to achieve positive buoyancy but highlighted the need for fins
and changes to weight distribution to help the tag stabilize
and keep the antenna in an upright orientation while under
tow. In particular, the lack of fins in the first iteration made
the tag unstable, resulting in highly variable horizontal move-
ment characterized by sudden peaks and valleys in drag forces
while submerged ( Fig. S1 ) that may increase the likelihood of
tether or tag anchor failure.

This instability is a notable engineering challenge because
objects floating at the surface versus those that are submerged
have conflicting requirements for achieving stability due to
variable interactions among the centers of buoyancy and grav-
ity. When floating, the center of buoyancy is typically below
that of gravity but, if subjected to lateral forces, it shifts off
axis as the object heels to one side and either causes a right-
ing moment or capsizes ( Fig. S2 , Smits 1999 ). In contrast, the
center of buoyancy of a submerged object is stationary and

to help overcome the impact of surface tension that could po-
tentially hold the antenna flat against the surface of the water
and prevent successful transmission.

−1 but 25% and 26% higher drag at 1.0 and 1.2 m s

Additional drag testing was conducted at the flume to com-
pare the SPOT-253 with the final iteration of the SPOT-413 in-
corporating these design changes ( Fig. 6 b). When the tags were
fully submerged, the SPOT-413 had significantly lower drag
forces—a 58%, 37%, and 35% lower median drag at 0.5,
−1 , respectively. However, at the surface, the
1.0, and 1.2 m s
SPOT-413 exhibited similar median drag to the SPOT-253 at
−1 ,
0.5 m s
respectively, highlighting a trade-off in drag when the tag is
floating versus submerged. For the SPOT-413, the higher sur-
face drag is due to the increased volatility of smaller objects in
turbulent conditions; however, the relatively higher drag expe-
−1 is still markedly lower
rienced by this tag at speeds ≥1.0 m s
than  that  experienced  by  the  SPOT-253  when  submerged.
While billfish will expose towed Argos satellite transmitters
to drag conditions at the air–water interface, these tags will
most often be submerged. Thus, we believe that the dramatic
reductions in submerged drag for the SPOT-413 should result
in increased deployment duration and that those benefits ex-
ceed the potential drawbacks of its relatively higher (but, in
absolute terms, still low) surface drag. Transmission perfor-
mance testing of the tags when being towed near the surface
revealed that both the SPOT-413 and SPOT-253 were able to
clear the air-water interface and transmit at the expected ca-
dence.

Field testing of the SPOT-413 on multiple species and size
classes of billfish is underway and will be the subject of a
future study, but here we demonstrate proof of concept for
effective performance of this tag during a real deployment.
In September 2024, we outfitted a white marlin ( Kajikia al-
bida ) with this new towed tag in the continental shelf waters
south of the islands of Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket in
the Northwest Atlantic ( Fig. 7 a). Over the course of 59 days
from the release date to the last location acquired as of writ-
ing, this tagged fish yielded a median of seven locations per day
( n = 424 total, Fig. 7 b), of which 65% were high-quality, num-
bered location classes ( Fig. 7 c). The raw locations suggest in-
teraction with fine-scale oceanographic features, such as those
generated by variability in Gulf Stream flow ( Fig. 7 a). These
preliminary data highlight the capacity of the SPOT-413 to re-
solve horizontal movements with orders of magnitude greater
accuracy than traditional PSAT tags.

F uture w ork

Key  considerations  for  future  studies  include  the  optimal
tether length and transmission uplink restrictions. Among the
pioneering uses of towed Argos satellite transmitters or GPS-
capable tags on billfish, tether lengths ranged from 10 cm on
swordfish (Evans et al. 2011 ) to 150 cm on sailfish (case study
above). For tagged fish near but below the surface, shorter
tethers may reach the air-water interface less frequently and
thereby  reduce  the  number  of  acquired  locations  over  the
course of a deployment. Longer tethers may provide more
satellite transmission opportunities in near-surface situations
but are more susceptible to tangling. A tether wrapped un-
der or around body parts can reduce the effective height the
transmitter can float above the fish (Nyegaard et al. 2023 ),
and entanglement with the caudal peduncle or fin may cause

needs to be above that of gravity to maintain a stable righting
moment ( Fig. S2 ). Since a towed tag needs to be stable under
both conditions, dual optimization of these conflicting func-
tions for the SPOT-413 was achieved by distributing weight to
improve stability as a floating object and adding posterior fins
to maintain stability when submerged. Other design changes
included repositioning of the tow point forward on the tag to
facilitate debris shedding over the tag more freely and reduce
entanglement concerns ( Fig. 6 a), as well as a stiffer antenna

dislodgement of the tag anchor or tether separation. Similarly,
the daily transmission uplink limit ranged widely from, for ex-
ample, 100 transmissions per day on shortbill spearfish with
a towed tag (Arostegui et al. 2024b ) to 1000 transmissions
per day on striped marlin with a fixed tag (Holdsworth et al.
2009 ). A higher daily uplink limit for Argos satellite trans-
mitters may enable acquisition of more locations per day and

finer scales of ecological inquiry but will more quickly reduce
the battery life and yield a shorter deployment duration. Given
that battery failure is the most common cause of transmitters
ultimately ceasing to send data, duty-cycling the transmitter
on and off to avoid attempting uplinks during periods of min-
imal satellite coverage represents an important way to atten-
uate loss of battery life (Hays et al. 2021 ).

Conclusion

Supplementary material

While ocean animals experience and respond to their envi-
ronment over a range of scales (e.g. Torres 2017 ), studies of
pelagic teleosts using PSATs are inherently limited to coarser
scales. This mismatch between animal behavior and the abil-
ity to observe it is a primary issue in ecology, as any sampling
technology biases our understanding to specific scales ( sensu
Levin 1992 ). Thus, the ability of Argos satellite transmitters
to provide high-resolution location data may offer a way to
observe and understand movement ecology of pelagic fishes at
finer scales than are currently possible with existing technolo-
gies. Billfishes represent ample opportunities as model species
given their frequent occupation of surface waters, which is a
prerequisite for successful transmission of location data from
the tag to overhead satellites. The new SPOT-413 towed tag
highlights continued innovation that will support scientific in-
quiry at increasingly finer scales, and the presented case stud-
ies demonstrate the potential for such fine-scale research on
billfishes.

NASA grant 80NSSC20K1132 and the SW O T Science Team.
Shortbill spearfish tagging was supported by the Offield Cen-
ter for Billfish Studies. Fieldwork in the Red Sea was sup-
ported by Michael Berumen (King Abdullah University of Sci-
ence and Technology) and the Coastline LLC vessel Bluewa-
ter . Les Gallagher (Fishpics ® & IMAR-DOP, University of the
Azores) produced the billfish artwork in Figs. 1 , 4 , 5 , and 7 .
Billfish tagging was conducted under protocols approved by
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at the Univer-
sity of Washington and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institu-
tion.
