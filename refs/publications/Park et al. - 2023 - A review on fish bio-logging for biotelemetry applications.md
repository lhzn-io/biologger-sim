Abstract
Fish are an essential resource in human society, and while ecological research on them is challenging, it is absolutely necessary.
Recent technologies enabled researchers to monitor underwater fish behavior. Acoustic signals, satellite-mediated location esti-
mation, and light-based geolocation are powerful tools for tracking fish movements from freshwater to deep-sea habitats. These
tools allow us to track various fish species and elucidate their ecology. Furthermore, based on these technologies, we can devel-
op fisheries management plans and enhance aquaculture productivity. In this review, we also discuss challenges in improving
current technologies and provide future recommendations for fish bio-logging studies.

Keywords: Fish tracking, Fishery, Bio-logging, Telemetry, Bio-logger

Introduction

Fish are a crucial resource in human societies, and understanding
their behavioral traits and seasonal habitats is important.
However, they not only move horizontally but also vertically,
making it quite challenging to track their movements. After
the first fish-tracking study on salmons (Trefethen et al., 1956),
various devices have been developed. We can now study various
fish species with a wide range of devices. There are many
kinds of devices for tracking the horizontal location of the fish
(Brownscombe et al., 2019; Hussey et al., 2015; Lowerre-Barbieri
et al., 2019) and also collecting swimming depth or environmental
data around them (Block et al., 1998; Coffey & Holland 2015).

We can now explore fish ecology questions more effectively using
these diverse bio-logging devices.

Advanced bio-logging study is important for constructing
fisheries management plans (Allen & Singh 2016; Crossin et
al., 2017; Secor, 2015) and for reducing disease and stress of
individuals in aquaculture (Mei et al., 2022). Fish tracking studies
reveal the habitat selection and seasonal migration patterns of
fish according to their developmental stages (Hazen et al., 2012).
For instance, a study with an acoustic telemetry device provided
movement data of various commercially important fish species,
such as Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua; Cote et al., 1998) and
winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus; DeCelles &
Cadrin 2010). In the case of pelagic fish study, satellite mediated

kinds of Bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus; Block et al., 1998) and
greater amberjack (Seriola quinqueradiata; Tone et al., 2022).
Furthermore, monitoring fish swimming behavior has the
potential to enhance the quality of products in the aquaculture
industry. Swimming data collected within an aquaculture
environment could be a valuable indicator representing water
quality or population densities (Alfonso et al., 2020; Martins et
al., 2012).

Here, we aimed to review the previous bio-logging research
and introduce the different types of bio-loggers for fish tracking.
Using the bio-logging keywords, we estimated the number
of publications on fish tracking studies. Then, we categorized
the earlier studies into different groups depending on the data
collecting and transmitting methods. We look forward to
contributing our review and a case study report to future studies
on the widespread application of fish bio-logging.

Bio-logging study trends in fish
To estimate the publication changes in fish bio-logging, we
browsed the Web of Science (<https://www.webofknowledge>.
com) and searched for research articles containing the keywords.
Because some researchers used “biologging” instead of “bio-
logging”, we included both. In addition, we included the terms
to indicate bio-logging devices (“biologger” and “bio-logger”).
Because bio-logging in fish is often called “telemetry”, we include
the terms (“animal telemetry” and “animal-borne telemetry”). In
addition, more generally, we included “tagging” and “tracking”.
To restrict our study in fish, we only allowed articles with “fish”
or “shark” or “Actinopterygi” or “Chondrichthyes”). This yields
9,411 publications by 2022). Among the total 9,411 articles, 1,487
were using “Acoustic” and 892 were using “Satellite”. The results
are presented in Fig. 1.

Since the first study with individual tagging on salmons
(Trefethen, 1956), fish tracking has begun. Due to the technical
limitations, however, only a few studies were reported. Then,
Priede  et  al.  (1984)  tracked  a  basking  shark  (Cetorhinus
maximus) by Advanced Research and Global Observation
Satellite (ARGOS) satellite with a ultra-high-frequency (UHF)
radio transmitter. This study proved that large aquatic animals
can be monitored for a long-term period with satellite tracking.
In the 21st century, the number of publications in both telemetry
and satellite tracking has annually increased.

Fig. 1. The number of publications related to fish bio-
logging studies (by 2022). We browsed Web of Science (<www>.
webofknowledge.com) to search for articles which contain the
keywords (“biologging” OR “bio-logging” OR “biotelemetry” OR
“biologger” OR “bio-logger” OR “animal telemetry” OR “animal-
borne telemetry” OR “tagging” OR “tracking”) AND (“fish” OR
“shark” OR “Actinopterygii” OR “Chondrichthyes”), yielding 9,411
publications.

Data collecting methods of bio-loggers
In fish bio-logging, we categorized the bio-loggers according to
the sensor types for fish movement research (Table 1). The main
research purpose of data is to locate the animals. Researchers
used acoustic-and radio-transmitters. By inserting a small
device into the body, it communicates with the stationary or
moving receivers when passing at a close distance (Fig. 2A).
Passive telemetry systems are based on scanning the coded
information from the receivers. Although the underwater
stationary communicating methods are still being commonly
used and efficient, more direct methods at the water surface are
communicating with satellite technologies. Since Block et al.
(1998) applied pop-up satellite tags on Atlantic bluefin tuna (T.
thynnus), many researchers have used this system for collecting
long-term data logging by releasing the tags to the surface and
communicating with the satellites (Fig. 2C). It provides data
collected under the water and sends information to the ARGOS
satellites. The released location can be determined from the
ARGOS communication places (which are called, ‘Collect
Localisation satellites (CLS)’ with ARGOS transmission). Still, it
is not collecting the movement locations in water. The swimming
locations before release should rely on other sensors, such as
a sunlight sensor (which is often called a ‘geolocation system
(GLS)’ with light intensity). To determine the accurate locations,
one of the most reliable geolocation devices is Global Positioning
System (GPS). Because GPS collects latitude and longitude

data from multiple satellites (more than three) by estimating
the distances from the receiver to each satellite. Thus, it enables
researchers to use highly accurate (< 10 m) (see Hulbert & French
2001). Despite the high accuracy, GPS has not been applied to
swimming fish due to the satellite communication under the
water. For better communication with GPS satellites, buoy-based
GPS telemetry was used in shallow swimmers (sunfish in Sims et
al., 2009; New Zealand eagle ray in Riding et al., 2009) (Fig. 2B).

Together with locations, depth and temperature sensors are

the main data for estimating the dive depths and ambient water
environment. Since Kooyman (1966) used time-depth recorders
on marine mammals (Weddell Seal, Leptonychotes weddelli),
it has been miniaturized and applied to fish as well for vertical
movement in time series. For 3D movement, accelerometers were
used to estimate the detailed movement and energy expenditure.
Acceleration has been used to examine the Blacktip reef shark
(Carcharhinus melanopterus) by counting the bite rates for
studying their daily hunting behavior (Papastamatiou et al., 2015).

Bio-logging applications for different behaviors and habitats
Fish inhabit a variety of habitats and exhibit different ecological
traits depending on their species. We have summarized previous
studies based on the habitat and behavior of fish species through
the following classification and schematic figure (Fig. 3).

fine-scale estimates of space use. In freshwater, the cover ranges
are relatively smaller and shallower, compared to other ocean
studies, radio-transmission has been the most used technique but
passive integrated transponder (PIT) technology and acoustic
telemetry have been more commonly used recently (Cooke et al.,
2013).

Neritic fish (Coastal fish) or freshwater fish
The dependence of acoustic telemetry on fixed receivers that
detect transmissions over small distances (< 1,000 m) has
focused the majority of research on coastal, estuarine, and
freshwater ecosystems (Hussey et al., 2015). Although detection
ranges decrease with noise (Pincock & Johnston 2012) and water
stratification (How & de Lestang, 2012), it has advantages for

Pelagic fish
Pelagic sharks have been tracked with ARGOS satellite trackers.
When sharks swim near the surface, the bio-loggers on the dorsal
fin or darting on the body could directly communicate with the
satellites (Hammerschlag et al., 2011). One of the commercial
satellite tags is the Wildlife Computers SPOT products (https://

<https://doi.org/10.47853/FAS.2023.e62Jikang> Park and Sung-Yong OhFisheries and Aquatic SciencesFig. 3. A commonly utilized bio-logging application across various fish habitats. Acoustic telemetry is frequently employed on
neritic fish, migratory fish, and the aquaculture industry. Meanwhile, in pelagic fish, satellite tracking devices (in surface-swimming
species) or pop-up archival devices are widely applied. In the case of deep-sea species, the pop-up device is the only method to
retrieve collected data.

wildlifecomputers.com/our-tags/spot-argos-satellite-tags/).
Location accuracy is up to 250 meters and the pressure sensor
covers 2,000 meters depth.

In highly mobile pelagic fish, such as tuna and billfish, light
sensor-based geolocation with pop-up archival tags (PAT tags)
has been widely used (Hammerschlag et al., 2011). Such PAT tags
are installed to track the long-term and large-scale movement.
When  animals  do  not  perform  enough  surface  diving  for
satellites, this pop-up can help researchers collect logged data.
The light data for determining sunrise and sunset time provides
geolocation, and the pressure and ambient temperature under
the water provide depth and water temperature data by sending
the signals to the ARGOS satellite after being released from the
animals. Equipped with other sensors, such as accelerometers
and oxygen sensors, can also contribute to the behavioral and
environmental dataset of the PAT tags.

Diadromous fish (Migratory fish)
Juvenile salmons hatch in freshwater migrate to the ocean for
growth, and turn back to their natal sites for breeding (Furey et
al., 2015). They are often called, ‘Anadromous fish’ and acoustic
transmitters have been applied to track their migratory routes

(Matley et al., 2022). Researchers inserted tiny acoustic- or radio-
transmitters to the juveniles born in fresh water and installed
acoustic transmitter-receivers along the candidate migratory
routes to follow their expected tracks and examine the survival
rates (Cooke et al., 2005; Furey et al., 2015; Thorstad et al., 2013).
This technique was also utilized to study the oceanic migration
routes of American eels (Béguer-Pon et al., 2014), which are
categorized as ‘Catadromous fish’.

Deep-sea fish
If fish live in deep-sea with little sunlight, it is not available to use
the light sensor for locating. For instance, Greenland sharks dive
as deep as 1,560 m in cold deep water (Fisk et al., 2012). Thus,
the current light-based geolocation is not easily applicable to this
species. Hussey et al. (2018) deployed multiple pop-up tags that
had been sequentially released per individual and estimated their
locations from the released water surface with the depth and
temperature data. Because such horizontal tracks are complex to
follow, researchers have focused on their vertical movement with
depth and temperature sensors as well as other environmental
sensors like dissolved oxygen (DO; Bluntnose sixgill shark in
Coffey & Holland 2015; Coffey et al., 2020).

A review on fish bio-logging for biotelemetry applications <https://doi.org/10.47853/FAS.2023.e62Fisheries> and Aquatic SciencesAquaculture industry
Fish aquaculture systems can induce stress and health problems
in fish (Broom, 2007), which can result in decreased productivity
of aquaculture. High population density or poor water quality
within fish farms can affect the swimming behavior of cultured
fish (Sneddon & Wolfenden, 2016). Acoustic telemetry is an
effective method for observing fish movement within a sea-cage
production system. There were several studies with acoustic
telemetry in the aquaculture industry (Føre et al., 2011; Kolarevic
et al., 2016) and it could provide a better strategy for fish farming.
For instance, an acoustic telemetry study of Atlantic cod (G.
morhua) exhibits higher swimming activity during daytime
compared with swimming activity during nighttime (Rillahan
et al., 2011). Furthermore, extending the day photoperiod using
artificial lights has been found to increase the swimming activity
of fish. Observing the movement of fish within fish farming
provides not only an understanding of their ecology but also
assists in managing the welfare of fish and enhancing production
levels (Crossin et al., 2017; Føre et al., 2011, 2018).

Domestic trends in fish bio-logging studies
Domestic fish bio-logging studies could provide insights into
the ecology of fish and serve as effective methods for fisheries
resource management. Acoustic telemetry, suitable for studying
fish behavior within its detection range, has been consistently
employed in various studies (reviewed in Choi et al., 2022),
including marine fish movement studies related to artificial
structures (Shin et al., 2004) and comparisons between the
movement of wild and cultured fish (Kang et al., 2008; Shin et
al., 2005). Furthermore, recent studies have been conducted
on migration of Mottled skate (Beringraja pulchra) (Im & Jo,
2015), Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) (Lee et al., 2015), and
yellowtail (S. quinqueradiata) (Kim et al., 2021) using pop-up
satellite archival tag devices. Fish bio-logging can identify the
impacts on fish caused by domestic anthropogenic disturbances.
Although there is a study indicating that noise from marine
construction affects the swimming behavior of marine fish
(Heo et al., 2019), there is still a significant gap in research on
the potential impacts of various marine development projects
on fish. Recently in South Korea, large-scale marine facility
constructions such as offshore wind farms have been underway,
and these could have an impact on the marine ecosystem
(Mooney et al., 2020). Therefore, we need active domestic
research on the interaction between marine development and the
marine ecosystem (Choi et al., 2022).

Challenges and future directions
Although acoustic telemetry has been widely used since the
1950s and is still one of the most popular methods to track
fish movement, it is limited to a short range from receivers.
To increase the data recovery rates, researchers share their
underwater receivers (Reubens et al., 2021; Young et al., 2020).
Also, the collected information is strongly encouraged to share
for collaboration among researchers, such as the Ocean Tracking
Network, Integrated Marine Observing System in Australia,
Integrated Tracking of Aquatic Animals in the Gulf of Mexico,
and the Acoustic Tracking Array Platform in South Africa
(Abecasis et al., 2018; Cooke et al., 2012). Thus, we expect that
an active international platform for receiver sharing and data
networks would increase the chances for collaborative studies
across the continents and oceans.

Since GPS can only transmit the signal to the satellite at
the surface of water, it can only be used on surface swimming
sharks, rays, or large pelagic fishes. Thus, the geolocation
method, which calculates the location based on sunrise and
sunset times, is widely used for estimating location despite its low
accuracy. Acoustic telemetry could be a more accurate method,
but generally, this method is used for studying neritic species
because of its short detection range. That is why we need a new
tracking technology. The RAFOS Ocean Acoustic Monitoring
(ROAM) tag, currently in the testing phase, is a long-range fish-
tracking method with acoustic signals (Braun et al., 2019). In
contrast to typical acoustic telemetry, the ROAM tag system
utilizes low-frequency sound which is more appropriate for long-
range communication than high-frequency sound. According
to a field test conducted at the Mississippi River Delta (Rossby
et al., 2017), the tag detected a low-frequency signal 60 km away
from the sound source and the estimated accuracy of location
tracking ranged from 70 to 560 m. This developing underwater
positioning technology could provide a more accurate and long-
range tracking method for studying fish.

Despite the clear benefits and advantages of bio-logging for
fish studies, the potential impacts of the tagged individuals have
been underestimated (reviewed in Klinard & Matley 2020). For a
long-term study, researchers should consider the impacts of the
bio-loggers and mortalities of the tracking results. Light weight
sensors could provide better options. A newly tested tiny acoustic
transmitter injection showed that it highly increased fish survival
rates compared to surgically implanted acoustic transmitters
(Deng et al., 2017). Non-invasive tagging system, with no
injection, such as a skin-type surface bandage, would help fish

the miniaturization of sensors will provide more chances for
researchers to conduct a broader range of studies. Current
bio-loggers are mainly used for large animals that can tolerate
the weight and dragging forces of the devices. For example,
fluorometers (Lander et al., 2015) and DO sensors (Coffey &
Holland 2015; Logan et al., 2022) are being used for sharks or
large fish. We look forward to making the loggers miniaturized
to apply the loggers even for small fish and multiple devices
simultaneously.
