Mesoscale eddies are critical components of the ocean’s “internal
weather” system. Mixing and stirring by eddies exerts signiﬁcant
control on biogeochemical ﬂuxes in the open ocean, and eddies
may trap distinctive plankton communities that remain coherent
for months and can be transported hundreds to thousands of kilo-
meters. Debate regarding how and why predators use fronts and
eddies, for example as a migratory cue, enhanced forage oppor-
tunities, or preferred thermal habitat, has been ongoing since the
1950s. The inﬂuence of eddies on the behavior of large pelagic
ﬁshes, however, remains largely unexplored. Here, we reconstruct
movements of a pelagic predator, the blue shark (Prionace glauca),
in the Gulf Stream region using electronic tags, earth-observing
satellites, and data-assimilating ocean forecasting models. Based
on >2,000 tracking days and nearly 500,000 high-resolution time
series measurements collected by 15 instrumented individuals, we
show that blue sharks seek out the interiors of anticyclonic eddies
where they dive deep while foraging. Our observations counter
the existing paradigm that anticyclonic eddies are unproductive
ocean “deserts” and suggest anomalously warm temperatures in
these features connect surface-oriented predators to the most
abundant ﬁsh community on the planet in the mesopelagic. These
results also shed light on the ecosystem services provided by
mesopelagic prey. Careful consideration will be needed before
biomass extraction from the ocean twilight zone to avoid inter-
rupting a key link between planktonic production and top preda-
tors. Moreover, robust associations between targeted ﬁsh species
and oceanographic features increase the prospects for effective
dynamic ocean management.

T he pelagic ocean represents the largest habitat on Earth

(99% of the biosphere) (1) and yields >80% of the ﬁsh
consumed by humans (1, 2). While typically featureless to the
human eye, open ocean ecosystems are highly dynamic in time
and space when viewed from satellites (3). Mesoscale eddies
are energetic entities that structure open ocean ecosystems on
time scales of weeks to months and spatial scales of tens to hun-
dreds of kilometers (4). Eddy processes at these scales provide
controls on biogeochemical ﬂuxes (4, 5) and affect biologi-
cal communities, including lower trophic levels (6–8), marine
mammals (9–12), birds (13), turtles (14, 15), and ﬁshes (16).
Coupling of biology and ocean physics at the mesoscale has,
in some cases, identiﬁed speciﬁc features as “hotspots” of bio-
logical activity, spanning trophic levels from primary producers
(17–20) to zooplankton and small ﬁsh (21), up to large pelagic
ﬁsh (22, 23).

The Gulf Stream region off the northeast coast of the United
States contains some of the most highly energetic eddies on
Earth (3), which have signiﬁcant impacts on ecosystem dynamics
(23–26). In this region, large cyclonic eddies (CEs) are gener-
ated by southward meanders of the Gulf Stream. These CEs
typically trap cold, productive water from the New England

shelf during formation (27) and are thus often referred to as
“cold-core rings.” On the other hand, large anticyclonic eddies
(ACEs) formed by northward Gulf Stream meanders (known as
warm-core rings) transport anomalously warm, low productivity
Sargasso Sea water north of the Gulf Stream (28). As a result
of the trapping of oligotrophic waters, Gulf Stream ACEs have
been characterized as warm, ocean “deserts” with low productiv-
ity (26, 29) (except see refs. 28 and 30). Eddies generated in the
open ocean also propagate into the Gulf Stream region and can
have remarkably different characteristics and vertical structure
(26) from those that are formed in the area.

Much of the existing research on these physical–biological
interactions in eddies has been bolstered by recent advances in
satellite oceanography that have facilitated the automatic iden-
tiﬁcation and tracking of mesoscale eddies globally (3). These
advances in our ability to observe and track mesoscale features
have revealed rich regional variability in how eddies inﬂuence
near-surface chlorophyll distributions (26) and how these fea-
tures might inﬂuence pelagic predators (e.g., ref. 23). Debate
regarding how and why predators use oceanographic features is
ongoing (31), and quantitative links between eddies and large

Signiﬁcance

New dynamic approaches to managing marine ﬁsheries
promise more effective management in a changing climate.
However, they require detailed knowledge of the links
between oceanographic features and marine megafauna.
Here, we demonstrate that satellite tracking of animal move-
ments, combined with ocean remote sensing and numerical
models, can provide this critical
information for the most
exploited pelagic shark in the Atlantic Ocean. We ﬁnd that
this predator dives deep in warm, swirling water masses
called eddies that have traditionally been considered ocean
“deserts.” Sharks use these warm features as a conduit to for-
age in the ocean twilight zone, a region of the deep ocean
that contains the largest ﬁsh biomass on Earth, highlighting
the importance of these deep ocean prey resources.

ﬁsh in the open ocean often cannot be determined with sufﬁ-
cient accuracy to correlate their position with speciﬁc mesoscale
oceanographic features (32, 33). However, if ﬁshes are able to
sense favorable conditions associated with mesoscale eddies,
as has been suggested for turtles (14), seabirds (34), marine
mammals (11), and indeed large white sharks (23), eddies are
likely to have profound impacts on the ecology of a number of
commercially and ecologically important ﬁsh species.

Here, we use electronic tags, Earth-observing satellites, and
data-assimilating ocean forecasting models to quantify eddy use
by the most heavily exploited pelagic shark in the Atlantic Ocean,
the blue shark. We estimated shark behavior using a hierarchi-
cal, switching state-space model framework and reconstructed
3D movements of tagged sharks by combining accurate, satellite-
based positions with a high-resolution time series of depth and
temperature. Observed and simulated random-walk movements
were collocated to the interior of mesoscale eddies tracked in
maps of remotely sensed sea surface height. We then used a
data-assimilating and eddy-resolving oceanographic model to
contextualize shark movements, compare observed behavior to
the marine environment, and develop eddy composites to deter-
mine vertical eddy structure. This unique combination of tools
and analyses allowed us to quantify speciﬁc shark–eddy interac-
tions and explore the inﬂuence of these dominant oceanographic
features on a model marine predator.

Results
We deployed 2 types of satellite-transmitting tags on 15 blue
sharks in the Gulf Stream eddy ﬁeld to provide high-resolution,
3D movements of each individual shark. We recorded >2,000
tracking days and nearly 500,000 high-resolution depth-tempera-
ture time series measurements from tagged blue sharks. Fifty-
eight percent (∼1,200 tracking days) of the standardized loca-
tions from the state-space model occurred in the Gulf Stream
study area (Fig. 1A), and 78% of these Gulf Stream positions
were recorded between October and February. Twenty-ﬁve per-
cent of the recorded depth-temperature time series data could
be matched to these concurrent locations in the Gulf Stream,
effectively facilitating reconstruction of 3D movements. These
data for each tagged individual were subsequently collocated to
mesoscale eddies tracked in maps of sea level anomaly in the
Gulf Stream study region.

Area-normalized histograms of shark positions (n = 4,791
Gulf Stream locations), as a function of distance from eddy cen-
ters, revealed that blue sharks were signiﬁcantly more likely to be
associated with the inner cores (see SI Appendix for deﬁnitions
of eddy areas) of ACEs than of CEs (Fig. 1). Depth-temperature
time series data indicated 30% of all Gulf Stream depth mea-
surements were made within eddies and comprised 452 and 181
cumulative hours within anticyclonic and cyclonic eddy cores,
respectively. The preference for ACEs was even stronger when
considering only movements while in the foraging behavior mode
(Fig. 1D). Among all standardized locations that were classiﬁed
as foraging across the Northwest Atlantic (including inside and
outside of the Gulf Stream region), 59% occurred in the Gulf
Stream study region and 40% were within eddies. Within Gulf
Stream eddies, 39% of depth time series data in ACEs was clas-
siﬁed as foraging compared with 24% in CEs, and among the
15,024 depth time series data points in the Gulf Stream that were
associated with the foraging behavior mode, 33% were in ACEs
and 11% in CEs.

Distribution of time at depth in eddies suggested blue sharks
foraged on diel vertically migrating, mesopelagic prey during
dives. Tagged individuals spent 15% of their time in Gulf Stream
ACEs, compared with 1.5% in CEs, at depths below 300 m dur-
ing daytime hours. At night, sharks spent <1% of their time
in the mesopelagic in eddies of either polarity (Fig. 2 E and

Fig. 1. Use of Gulf Stream eddies by satellite-tagged blue sharks. (A and B)
Blue sharks tagged in New England (green triangle) frequented the Gulf
Stream eddy ﬁeld (A) and occupied anticyclonic eddies (ACEs) (red) and
cyclonic eddies (CEs) (blue) at approximately the same frequency (B). (C)
Eddy-centric histograms of random-walk simulations (solid line) and pas-
sive drifters (dashed line) exhibited higher frequency in CEs after controlling
for eddy area. (D) Eddy-centric histograms of shark locations show they use
eddy peripheries approximately equally between CEs and ACEs, but more
positions classiﬁed as “foraging” (solid line) were collocated around the
eddy interior compared with “transiting” locations (dashed line). Sharks
showed a marked preference for the cores of ACEs relative to CEs, partic-
ularly while foraging (D). The ratios of ACE to CE positions across different
regions of the eddies are shown in E for random-walk simulations (solid line)
and drifters (dashed line) and in F for shark movement classiﬁed as foraging
(solid line) and transiting (dashed line). Note conﬁdence intervals have been
removed from the transit mode in D to aid visualization.

F). While diving, sharks encountered anomalously warm tem-
peratures at depth in ACEs (Fig. 2 A and C), often exceeding
10 ◦C above climatological values in the strata between 250 m
and 350 m (SI Appendix, Figs. S1 and S2). Tagged sharks expe-
rienced negative temperature anomalies at depth in most CEs
(Fig. 2 B and D and SI Appendix, Figs. S1 and S2), yet paradox-
ically the deepest dives were also in cyclonic eddies. We found
that the CEs frequented by the tagged blue sharks were, in fact,
anomalously warm compared with eddy vertical composites con-
structed from climatological observations (Fig. 2B). Tracking
the warm CEs back to their formation indicated that they were
of Sargasso Sea origin (not Gulf Stream cold-core rings) and
had moved into the southern portion of the Gulf Stream study
area. After accounting for the CEs originating in the Sargasso
Sea, we found that tagged sharks rarely occupied cold-core Gulf
Stream CEs and favored warm Sargasso-derived CEs instead
(Fig. 3 E and F).

The observed differences in temperature at depth among
ACEs, Gulf Stream CEs, and Sargasso-derived CEs suggest that
eddy effects on subsurface temperature modulate shark diving
behavior (Fig. 3). Tagged sharks rarely ventured below the 12 ◦C
isotherm (Fig. 3 E and F), which led us to develop a metric (D (cid:48);
Eq. 1) to quantify the relationship between shark maximum dive
depth relative to the climatological mean depth of the 12 ◦C

isotherm. Values of D (cid:48) > 0 are indicative of anomalously deep
diving relative to the climatological mean isotherm depth. Dive
proﬁles in ACEs were primarily characterized by positive D (cid:48)
while CEs more often exhibited D (cid:48) < 0 (Fig. 3E), suggesting eddy
modulation of water column structure controlled shark behavior
in these features. We conﬁrmed this observation by comparing
climatological mean depth of the 12 ◦C isotherm to modeled in
situ depth in eddies that showed ACEs consistently exhibited
deepening of the 12 ◦C isotherm relative to climatological data
(Fig. 3F).

Discussion
Mesoscale eddies are thought to structure pelagic ecosystems
(4, 35). Recent work has shown the efﬁcacy of incorporating
these important, but ephemeral, oceanographic features into
dynamic approaches to ﬁsheries management (36, 37). How-
ever, these tools require detailed knowledge of the links between
oceanography and ﬁsheries targets or species of conservation
concern. Our results demonstrate an approach that provides
these data for the most heavily exploited pelagic shark in the
Atlantic Ocean.

The Gulf Stream is one of the most dynamic regions of the
world ocean and contains some of the most highly energetic
eddies on Earth (3). Conventional wisdom suggests that cyclonic
anticlockwise-rotating eddies are hotspots of biological activity
while clockwise-rotating anticyclonic eddies are ocean deserts
characterized by anomalously warm water void of signiﬁcant
ﬁsh biomass (29). However, our results suggest that blue sharks
use the cores of anticyclonic ocean eddies as conduits to for-
age at depths that they would otherwise be unable to reach
due to thermal constraints on their physiology. Our results are
strikingly similar to conclusions drawn from earlier work on
blue sharks that suggested thermal hysteresis facilitates main-
tenance of body temperatures signiﬁcantly above ambient in
the mesopelagic followed by abrupt termination of deep dives
when muscle cools to 15 ◦C (38). We also observed similar
oscillatory diving into the mesopelagic during daytime in both
types of Gulf Stream eddies that was apparently constrained
by temperature at depth. This behavior is consistent with the
behavioral thermoregulation observed by earlier researchers
(38) and is suggestive of foraging on vertically migrating meso-
pelagic prey.

Blue sharks are known to make extensive movements through-
out the pelagic North Atlantic (39), and previous work has
suggested the Gulf Stream may be an important overwinter-
ing habitat (40, 41). Previous studies tracking blue sharks in
the Gulf Stream reported a high frequency of taxa that exhibit
diel vertical migration, such as octopods (38) and mesopelagic
ﬁsh (42), in their stomachs. In addition, mesopelagic dives by
blue sharks were nearly always during daytime when the bulk
of the mesopelagic community is at depth (43), and shark
dive proﬁles were characterized by rapid descents with slower
ascents, a pattern interpreted as prey searching behavior in
sharks and tunas (38). Taken together, blue sharks are likely
foraging for cephalopods and mesopelagic ﬁshes, some of the
blue sharks’ primary prey items (42). These prey taxa are known
to concentrate at depth in the Gulf Stream (44) and have
been collected in high densities in ACEs (21, 45). Thus, our
results suggest that Gulf Stream eddies may present impor-
tant foraging opportunities, particularly during the overwintering
period that comprised the majority of our study period, and,
despite their low chlorophyll surface expression, ACEs may
therefore provide more proﬁtable foraging opportunities com-
pared with CEs. The combination of warmer temperatures at
depth and higher prey density would provide a powerful moti-
vation for blue sharks to occupy the cores of ACEs compared
with CEs. Endothermic white sharks apparently foraged deep
in cold CEs in the same general area as the blue sharks we
tagged (23). However, white shark dives were shorter in CEs
than in ACEs, indicating that thermal physiology also constrains
vertical movements of sharks capable of maintaining body tem-
peratures signiﬁcantly above ambient. These results further cor-
roborate the role of physiology in regulating physical–biological
interactions and suggest that more data are needed before
concluding that either eddy type provides a better foraging
environment.

Mesopelagic habitats in the open ocean contain the highest
ﬁsh biomass on Earth (46). However, the deep ocean presents
signiﬁcant physiological challenges for epipelagic predators
attempting to forage there. Our data suggest that ACEs may
provide a conduit from the surface to the deep ocean due
to anomalously warm temperatures at depth. This may enable
blue sharks to overcome thermal constraints that would other-
wise prevent them from accessing these resources. Our ﬁnding

that dynamic mesoscale eddies modulate connections between
the surface ocean and biomass in the mesopelagic has signif-
icant management and policy implications. For instance, cur-
rent management approaches ignore dynamic ocean processes
in favor of static and space-based management approaches
(47). While models to facilitate dynamic ocean management
have recently been proposed (48), these approaches to man-
aging pelagic ﬁsheries require an improved understanding of
the dominant physical–biological mechanisms structuring pelagic
ecosystems. Similarly, efforts to calculate ecosystem services
provided by mesopelagic animals remain remarkably imprecise,
at least in part because they ignore the effect of mesoscale
oceanographic features when scaling up from limited empir-
ical data to global biomass estimates (49). Finally, we pro-
vide further evidence of the potential value of mesopelagic
communities to large pelagic ﬁshes that are a vital compo-
nent of pelagic ﬁsheries catches throughout the global ocean.
Removal of mesopelagic biomass by industrial-scale ﬁshing oper-
ations is therefore likely to have signiﬁcant impacts on stocks
of tuna, swordﬁsh, and pelagic sharks. These impacts need
to be quantiﬁed before informed policy can be developed for

the sustainable and equitable use of resources in the ocean
twilight zone.

Materials and Methods
Satellite Tagging and Track Analysis. Each blue shark (n = 15) was tagged
with 2 electronic tags that provided accurate (<10 km error) satellite-based
positions (ﬁn-mounted Wildlife Computers SPOT tag) and a time series of
depth and temperature every 2.5 min (tethered Wildlife Computers miniPAT;
SI Appendix). Two additional blue sharks were tagged with SPOT tags only.
Locations were speed ﬁltered to remove spurious positions and were then
ﬁtted in a hierarchical fashion with a 2-state switching state-space model
(SSM) (50) to estimate locations from the Argos data, infer behavioral state,
and standardize the location time series (6-h resolution). Resulting positions
were used to collocate depth and temperature data for reconstruction of
3D movements.

The SSM combined a process model that estimated movement parame-
ters and an observation model that accounted for spatial uncertainty using
Markov chain Monte Carlo chains. The model inferred a behavior state
based on ﬁtted movement parameters (correlation, γ; and turn angle, θ).
Resident behavior (often referred to as area-restricted search or foraging)
was characterized by θ near 180◦ and γ near 0 (short steps with large
turn angles), while traveling (or transit) behavior produces movements in
which θ is near 0◦ and γ near 1 (long, relatively straight tracks) between

The SSMs were ﬁtted in JAGS
(51) using the beam package (50) for R (52) (see SI Appendix for additional
model details and assessment criteria). The raw tracking data are published
in the Data One repository (53).

Eddies. Eddies identiﬁed and tracked in daily maps of sea surface height
were acquired from the Mesoscale Eddy Trajectory Atlas distributed by
Aviso that describes daily tracks of coherent mesoscale structures (eddies)
based on maps of surface altimetry (3). Eddies with lifetimes greater than
4 wk are tracked based on their signatures in sea-level anomaly (SLA) ﬁelds.
A custom meander ﬁlter was used to distinguish Gulf Stream meanders from
the eddies of interest. Eddy subregions were deﬁned according to the radial
distance from the eddy center following ref. 14. Null eddy use was quan-
tiﬁed by 2 independent methods: 100 correlated random-walk simulations
per shark that sampled from observed turn angles and step lengths and
5 y of surface drifter data within the study region. Eddy vertical composites
were constructed for shark-occupied eddies using HYCOM-modeled depth-
temperature proﬁles and anomalies used climatological mean temperature
from the World Ocean Atlas. Finally, we developed a metric (D(cid:48)) to quantify
when eddies modulate shark dive depth by shifting the climatological 12 ◦C
isotherm

D(cid:48)(x, y, t) = D(x, y, t) − D12(x, y, t),
[1]
where D(cid:48) is the depth anomaly of each dive, D is the maximum depth
of each dive, and D12 is the climatological mean depth of the 12 ◦C

isotherm from the World Ocean Atlas. This metric indicates when eddies
modulate shark dive depth by facilitating dives shallower (D(cid:48) < 0) or
deeper (D(cid:48) > 0) than the climatological 12 ◦C isotherm. Eddy modu-
lation of isotherm depth was further analyzed by comparing HYCOM-
modeled in situ depth of the 12 ◦C isotherm within eddies with the
climatological mean.
