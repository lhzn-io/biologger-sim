Instruments attached to animals (‘biologgers’) have facilitated extensive discoveries
about the patterns, causes, and consequences of animal behavior. Here, we present
examples of how biologging can deepen our fundamental understanding of ecosys-
tems and our applied understanding of global change impacts by enabling tests of
ecological theory. Applying the iterative process of science to biologging has en-
abled a diverse set of insights, including social and experiential learning in long-
distance migrants, state-dependent risk aversion in foraging predators, and re-
source abundance driving movement across taxa. Now, biologging is poised to
tackle questions and reﬁne ecological theories at increasing levels of complexity
by integrating measurements from numerous individuals, merging datasets from
multiple species and their environments, and spanning disciplines, including
physiology, behavior and demography.

Testing and reﬁning ecological theories with biologgers
A holistic understanding of complex ecological processes requires creative solutions for col-
lecting data across sites, species, and systems. Archival or transmitting instruments attached
to animals (hereafter, biologgers) (see Glossary) have become routine tools for recording phys-
iological, behavioral, and demographic characteristics of individuals, and for inferring their interac-
tions with environmental and ecological features [1] (Figure 1). These animal and ecosystem
insights are obtained through various levels of data processing by the researcher, ranging from
minimal (sensors that measure heart rates and ambient light levels) to extensive (calculations of
activity budgets and energy expenditure from sensor measurements)
(Figure 1 and see
Table S1 in the supplemental information online). The resulting discoveries in animal physiology,
ecology, and evolution span temporal and spatial extents and resolutions that far exceed those
possible from traditional observation and mark–recapture approaches. Major discoveries include
understanding how navigation abilities allow animals to migrate across the globe and how phys-
iological and anatomical adaptations allow animals to inhabit harsh regions such as polar and
deep-ocean habitats.

The rapid development of biologging has motivated numerous proposals for future direc-
tions. The biologging community has been urged to integrate with other disciplines [2], use
mathematics and optimality [3], re-unite big data approaches with ﬁeld-based ecological
processes [4], target key knowledge gaps [5], learn lessons from human mobility research
[6], and reconnect tools and questions [7,8]. In recent years, biologging studies have transi-
tioned from describing unique biological observations to adopting a more rigorous scientiﬁc

Highlights
Many animal characteristics that strongly
inﬂuence population, community, and
ecosystem dynamics are difﬁcult or im-
possible to measure using traditional
ﬁeld methods.

Biologging sensors enable broad-scale,
high-resolution measurements of the
physiological, behavioral, demographic,
social, and environmental
interactions
underpinning patterns in nature.

We present a framework, case studies,
and outstanding questions for integrating
biologging data with theoretical con-
cepts to facilitate process explanation
and prediction.

Future studies should use biologging
technology to rigorously test ecological
hypotheses, transitioning from pattern
description to reﬁning and advancing
ecological theory.

approach. Now, researchers typically formulate deﬁned questions, ensure adequate sample
sizes, and conduct in-depth analyses, shifting from simple movement descriptions to
hypothesis-driven investigations. Biologging studies have also applied ‘big-data’ ap-
proaches to tackle behavioral and ecological mechanisms underlying animal movement
and the proximate internal and external factors that constrain them [9,10]. In turn, the discover-
ies and natural history descriptions enabled by biologging technology are primed for testing and
reﬁning long-standing ecological theories [11], with implications for broad generalizations [12]
and evidence-based conservation solutions [13].

We believe a critical next step is to use biologging to answer questions that span multiple taxa,
such as whether generalizable ‘rules’ underpin complex movements and species interactions
[14]. For many emerging questions, ecological theory exists to generate hypotheses about how
animals behave, and how behavior scales up to shape species’ distributions and broader ecosys-
tem processes [15]. In contrast to controlled laboratory experiments, biologging facilitates mea-
surements in natural settings where competing selective pressures such as predation, starvation,
competition, and infection exist. For example, data from satellite trackers and accelerometers
can be used to estimate foraging rates and prey densities to test hypotheses about functional
responses (i.e., the shape of the curve that describes prey capture rates by predators as a
function of prey availability) (Figure 1). We illustrate the potential of data from biologgers to in-
tegrate complex data into mechanistic evaluations, thereby offering a powerful approach
to hypothesis testing and theory reﬁnement.

Examples of development from discovery to theory
We provide three case-studies that range from single-species behavioral research to multispe-
cies interactions and consequences for population dynamics (Figure 2). In these examples, we
highlight the progression from pattern description to hypothesis testing to theory development
and suggest directions for future research.

State-dependent risk-taking throughout oceanic foraging in elephant seals
Body condition is hypothesized to mediate how animals navigate risk–reward trade-offs;
however, the difﬁculty of simultaneously measuring body condition, predation risk, and food re-
wards in the wild has limited our understanding of how intrinsic states affect risk-taking behav-
ior [16]. Biologgers have begun to address this gap by collecting data on animal movement
behavior. For instance, time-depth recorders facilitated the discovery that northern elephant
seals (Mirounga angustirostris) cease swimming and passively drift during some dives [17].
The discovery of these so-called ‘drift dives’ led to the hypothesis that seals in inferior body
condition with less body fat would sink faster [18]. Later, this hypothesis was tested with lon-
gitudinal energy gain rates [19], enabling drift dives to be used as a valuable metric for estimat-
ing body composition [20] at ﬁne spatiotemporal scales throughout oceanic foraging trips. In
addition, measurements of drifting seals were used to test hypotheses about the functions of
drift dives for resting and food processing [21,22]. Finally, drift dive analysis provided a method
to estimate daily body composition and time–activity budgets throughout months-long oceanic
foraging trips, which enabled the testing of predictions from state-dependent risk-taking
theory regarding optimal periods for animals to rest and forage [23]. This three-decade re-
search arc, examining whether behavior is state-dependent throughout oceanic foraging
trips, demonstrated that seals in superior body condition sacriﬁce more proﬁtable nighttime
foraging hours to sleep in the safety of darkness (Figure 2) [23]. More broadly, this research
provides insights into how other wild animals may move relative to ambient light levels, partic-
ularly in marine environments where light levels are mediated by depth in addition to location
and time-of-day.

Trends in Ecology & Evolution

Developing new technologies and analytical approaches enables the study of state-dependent
behavior in free-ranging animals. New on-board processing algorithms have been developed
to estimate and transmit real-time body composition data to test state-dependent behavior in
marine species that do not perform drift dives [24]. Likewise, other components of an
animal’s internal state (e.g., hunger, heat, stress, and exhaustion [25]) may inﬂuence behavior
and could be measured with new sensors. In the future, state-of-the-art physiological biologgers
that measure brain activity [26] and heart rate [27] could be used to test theories of physiological
recharge, rebound, and replenishment (e.g., sleep quotas) in other species [28]. Additionally,
simultaneously instrumenting predators and prey across dynamic conditions [29–31], which
has been achieved in some study systems, could be used to test theoretical predictions
of dynamic landscapes of fear or energy landscapes frameworks.

Social and experiential learning in whooping cranes
Understanding how animals learn long-distance migrations has implications for wildlife conserva-
tion and management, including the likely success of protected area designation and species
reintroductions or translocations. The role of social versus experiential learning in migratory be-
havior has been tested in studies of reintroduced whooping cranes (Grus americana) (Figure 2).
Using satellite transmitters and very high frequency (VHF) radio telemetry tags, the movements
and survival of re-introduced cranes demonstrated successful migration and dispersal patterns
[32] and motivated hypothesis testing about whether reintroduced cranes migrate more efﬁciently
when ﬂying with experienced birds [33]. A long-term satellite tracking dataset indicated an ontoge-
netic switch from social to experiential learning as birds age, allowing them to track resources
throughout their migration at all ages [34]. This work transitioned from initial descriptive discoveries
(examining whether reintroduction was a successful management strategy) to theory-testing
(disentangling the roles of social versus experiential learning).

Future biologging research could provide answers to many remaining questions pertaining to an-
imal learning and social interactions. For example, biologgers could help resolve the population-
level consequences of interrupted information transfer (e.g., by human-made noise) in systems
where social learning is a primary mechanism shaping movement strategies [35]. Likewise,
many facets of information gathering, particularly social cues and eavesdropping on other spe-
cies, remain poorly understood but could be answered with animal-borne microphones or
video recorders [36,37].

Migration based on past and current resource availability across species
Foundational biologging discoveries about memory and behavioral compensation have set
the stage for rich theory and emerging tools to address long-standing questions about migra-
tion [38]. One area that has seen signiﬁcant theoretical progress across species and systems is
the inﬂuence of variation in resource availability on migratory behavior (Figure 2). In the late
1970s, researchers observed simultaneous changes in plant phenology and migratory move-
ments in waterfowl [39]. Later, biologgers were used to examine the link between vegetation
green-up and ungulate migration decisions [40]. Follow-up studies tested hypotheses that
mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) migrate in concert with green-up, maximizing the intake of
high-quality forage along migration routes [41], and that the rate and order of green-up inﬂu-
ences the ability of animals to green-wave surf [42]. Simulation of zebra (Equus burchelli
antiquorum) and mule deer movement, and empirical validation with GPS tracks, showed
that previous experience (memory) of green-up patterns also plays an essential role in migration
[43,44]. More recently, biologging data has been used to suggest revising movement theory to
include the roles of memory [45] and social cues [37] alongside the traditional drivers of con-
temporaneous environmental conditions perceived by individuals.

Figure 1. Data generated by archival or transmitting biologgers can be used to calculate extrinsic and intrinsic variables (colored ovals) that can be used
to address key research topics (white squares) in behavior and ecology. These research topics span individual, population, community, and ecosystem scales,
and cross traditional disciplinary boundaries (red, demography; gold, physiology; green, behavior; orange, sociality; purple, species interactions). Note that there are
several critical steps, such as data conversions, processing, and analysis, between raw sensor-derived measurements and the variables presented here (see Table S1
in the supplemental information online). For example, species interactions between predators and prey can be measured by pairing accelerometers and acoustic
loggers (attached to prey) that measure escape movement responses to predator vocalizations. Illustration by Jessica Kendall-Bar.

Biologging science could be used to address how migratory animals respond to environmental
drivers. New technologies are facilitating the measurement of in situ resource distribution and
abundance at a sufﬁciently ﬁne resolution to inform theory about animal movement. For example,
Chevallay et al. [46] used a novel animal-borne echosounder to measure prey detection and capture
events so that estimates of sensory perception volume could be made. Continuing to ground these
research efforts in existing theory (e.g., framing the introduction with previous work on resource pat-
terns such as pulses [47] and waves [48]) can help maximize insights into how movement patterns
emerge from stochastic resource patterns such as irregular rainfall or unpredictable ﬁre events. More-
over, testing distinct theories with a common set of data [e.g., predation risk aversion (a top-down
process) and resource tracking (a bottom-up process)] could advance our understanding of
how movement outcomes result from risk–reward trade-offs [48].

Biologging for the future
Although many ecological studies that leverage biologging tools have been descriptive, contem-
porary research can effectively test theory by building on past insights while focusing on general-
izable patterns, testing hypotheses, and linking patterns to ecological processes (Figure 2). Many
individual examples of biologging studies in both the marine and terrestrial realms test theory
(Figure 3). The highlighted studies share many common approaches to their organization and
focus, including (i) the introductions are often framed with generalizable patterns in addition to
system-speciﬁc information, (ii) the background information often includes theory papers that

Many theoretical and conceptual questions require synthesizing multiple biologging datasets.
Doing so can produce more generalizable knowledge about patterns and processes in the natu-

research is bridging terrestrial and marine systems. Likewise, re-analyzing and synthesizing
datasets can maximize insights and minimize research impacts by reducing the need to instru-
ment additional animals.

Integration of biologging with auxiliary data
Understanding and predicting the spatiotemporal dynamics of populations is a central goal in
ecology and conservation, and requires understanding variation in, and genetic and phenotypic
drivers of, demographic rates [54–56]. Integrating biologging with auxiliary datasets and comple-
mentary disciplines can enable tests of hypotheses that span traditional boundaries (Table S1).
For example, integrating biologging with demographic data from mark–recapture programs
could be used to quantify the ﬁtness consequences of movement behavior [57,58]. Moreover,
considering species-level traits (e.g., body size, brain size, reproductive characteristics, and
diet) when analyzing tracking data [59] or conducting vulnerability risk assessments could facili-
tate valuable ecological-evolutionary insights. Biologging data can also facilitate insights into
human–wildlife conﬂict theory through ﬁeld-based experiments that combine camera traps,
audio recorders, and biologgers to quantify movement responses to simulated human activity
and conservation interventions [60,61].

Novel tools and approaches
Using existing biologging data to address new questions outside those of the initial study is
sometimes problematic. In these cases, new tools may be needed to answer a given conceptual
question. Here, concept-driven motivation for improved tagging technologies can drive the col-
laborative development of smaller and longer-lasting biologgers and more reliable sensors that
overcome current limitations in measuring the covariates that matter to animals (e.g., in situ re-
sources, predator abundance, multimodal sensory information perception and processing,
real-time infection, and heat stress) [62].

Inclusive, equitable practices
More equitable approaches to biologging science, including data collection, processing, archiv-
ing, and reporting, will provide the greatest impact and the broadest participation by diverse indi-
viduals, institutions, and nations. For example, the research community can seek to understand
and preserve the socioecological systems within which the animals exist through global and inter-
disciplinary collaborators [8], including Indigenous communities who should be compensated for
their time and meaningfully involved in study design decisions based on their knowledge of the
system [i.e., development of research question(s), instrumentation size, and handling and attach-
ment methods] [63,64]. Likewise, a global tag registry could help the biologging community and
public know whom to contact about sampling efforts and datasets to optimize the probability and
efﬁciency of collaboration [65]. Standardized and reproducible data can fast-track theory-testing
across systems by facilitating synthesis of large global biologging datasets [66]. This is especially
needed for nonspatial data such as physiologging, accelerometry, and video data that do not ﬁt
the standards developed for spatial data [67]. Open-access publication of those datasets must
credit those who collect and share data [68]. Finally, partnering with theoreticians will allow empir-
icists to identify promising areas for theory development and reﬁnement using biologging data.

Concluding remarks
There is a wide range of novel research directions that can be pursued with biologgers, ranging
across temporal and spatial scales (Figure 4; seeOutstanding questions ). The key to moving
from anecdote to generalizable theory is to examine interdisciplinary patterns and processes
across species and habitats. For example, habitat selection can be inﬂuenced by the population
context (e.g., density and social dynamics), by the community context (e.g., predators and

spatial scales. Each topic is colored by discipline (blue, morphology; gold, physiology; green, behavior; red, demography;

understood from a theoretical perspective but are primed for empirical testing through ﬁner-resolution or larger-scale
biologging data. For others, extensive empirical data could challenge or reﬁne theory by identifying deviations from
optimality or highlighting discrepancies between theory and empirical data. Many topics represent signiﬁcant opportunities
for developing both theory and empirical evidence, especially across disciplinary boundaries. All can be used as an
agenda for further research and a benchmark for future evaluations of progress in biologging science.

competitor density), and by the environmental context (e.g., drought, ﬁre) (Figure 1). Similarly, the-
ory can be applied to the many roles played by humans (e.g., predators, resource drivers, disease
sources) to inform conservation and management actions such as reserve design and species
protection [69]. Predictive models used for these decisions will be most accurate when informed
by a process-based understanding of animal movements and their roles in ecological systems
[70]. For example, understanding how animals move relative to human-made barriers such as
fences and highways can allow predictions about how increasing urbanization and development
will reduce wildlife ﬁtness as the human population grows. Likewise, characterizing links between
animal performance and environmental conditions can facilitate predictions of how climate
change will trigger species range shifts and population declines.

Biologging enables efﬁcient, ﬁne-scale data collection that can provide the breadth and depth
needed to develop, test, and reﬁne our understanding of ecological processes in our rapidly

changing world (Figure 2). Although new theories are rare in ecology, new technological develop-
ments can allow existing theories or hypotheses to ﬁnally be tested or reﬁned, so long as the re-
search has a strong conceptual focus (Figure 3) [58]. Of course, theory testing and reﬁnement are
not always possible. Research is still in the description and discovery phase for species that have
never been instrumented or that inhabit under-studied regions and biomes. In these cases, a
closer connection between conceptual questions and biologging technology can expedite the
development of new theories and contribute to the iterative process of testing and reﬁnement
[7]. Through these avenues, biologging can provide insight into how nature works and provide
a roadmap for better protection of species, ecosystems, and the services they provide [68].
