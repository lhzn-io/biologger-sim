How researchers can maximize
biological insights using animal-
tracking devices

Biologgers allow us to see with unprecedented precision how animals move and behave in the wild. But that’s

only part of the picture, according to a UC Santa Cruz ecologist renowned for using biologging data to tell the

deeper story about the lives of marine mammals in a changing world.

Biologgers allow us to see with unprecedented precision how animals move and behave in the wild. But

that’s only part of the picture, according to a UC Santa Cruz ecologist renowned for using biologging

data to tell the deeper story about the lives of marine mammals in a changing world.

In a new opinion piece published on October 30 in Trends in Ecology and Evolution, researchers present

a framework intended to underscore the value of biologging data for testing important questions about

the natural world. They urge that now is the time to build upon “discovery-based science,” where

observations are presented as research findings—by framing data collection, analysis, and

interpretation around specific questions posed by scientific theories.

“We emphasize the power and promise of theory-driven research,” said study lead author Roxanne

Beltran, assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology. “For example, if we hypothesize that

animals take more risks when they’re more hungry, can we use biologging tools to test and refine this

theory by measuring both hunger and risk-taking in wildlife?”

In other words, instead of doing research that concludes with describing the data, researchers can now

begin with a general idea of how the natural world works, and then use biologgers attached to animals

to strategically test whether that idea is supported by data.

How biologgers can help generalize insights

In their review, the team demonstrates how biologgers can be a powerful tool for testing hypotheses

and refining theories via case studies of elephant seals, whooping cranes, and mule deer. These case

studies demonstrate that observations made from biologgers can lead to insights that inform

hypotheses and refine ecological theories. Using ecological theory to link the physiology, sociality, and

demography of an animal with its environmental context allows for a better understanding of these

systems, the piece states.

For example, depth-measuring biologgers attached to northern elephant seals revealed that, at certain

points, the animals stopped swimming and started passively drifting. This previous research led to the

hypothesis that seals might drift because they are asleep, and that this might be due to differences in

physiology.

With biologgers, researchers were able to confirm that seals with superior body condition (more body

fat) skipped foraging at night to sleep in the safety of darkness. In contrast, seals with inferior body

condition (less body fat) foraged at night, when it was more efficient, but then risked sleeping during the

day when risk of predation from sharks and killer whales was higher. This led to support of state-

dependent risk-taking theory, backed by biologging data, that wild animals are more likely to take risks

when they are in poorer body condition.

“We’ve used these case studies as examples of the many exciting opportunities for new insights across

finer temporal scales and broader spatial scales than ever before,” Beltran said. “We hope that our

framework makes others feel excited and motivated by how much potential we have to apply these

biologging tools and generate ecological insights in the next couple of decades.”

More inclusivity in ecology research

In addition to her marine ecology research, Beltran has strongly advocated for diversity, equity, and

inclusion in STEM through the development of actionable field guides on anti-racism, community

building, and inclusive research experiences. In this new piece, she calls for open access to biologger

data so scientists without the resources to acquire expensive technology can still contribute to the field.

Eighteen of the article’s authors are early-career researchers, including graduate students, postdocs,

and research technicians like Conner Hale, who contributed by conceptualizing the case studies into a

graphic for the paper. She started in Beltran’s lab as an undergraduate field assistant three years ago

and now works with Beltran full time.

“I was involved from the ground up in creating Figure 2. Working on it allowed me to improve my

science communication skills, gain experience in simplifying text into an image, and collaborate with

my team, which are skills that will benefit me as I continue to pursue a career in research,” said Hale

(Carson, ‘22, marine biology). “I’m currently doing the kind of research that I hope to pursue in grad

school, and getting this experience now is setting me up for success.”

Beltran said collaborating with colleagues locally and internationally was crucial for showing the

scientific community how biologgers can be used to produce more holistic research in the years ahead.

“I knew that I could lead a much more powerful paper if I brought together a large group of young

researchers who had unique but complementary visions for the future of the field,” she explained.

The future of biologging

One exciting next step identified by the researchers is to expand the scale of inquiry. For instance,

researchers could leverage theories about species interactions to motivate the simultaneous tagging of

predators and prey in the same ecosystem. Mathematical models could then be used to create

simulations of populations, communities, and ecosystems under climate change scenarios that would

ultimately inform evidence-based conservation solutions.

“When disciplines are new, they necessarily begin with discovery of patterns,” Beltran said. “We believe

that transitioning toward process-based insights will allow biologging science to continue having an

enormous impact on our understanding of the natural world.”

Other co-authors of the paper from UC Santa Cruz include A. Marm Kilpatrick, Arina Favilla, Allison

Payne, Danial Palance, Daphne Shen, Dan Costa, Natalie Storm, and Patrick Robinson. The team also

included contributors from the University of Idaho, University of Washington, University of Wyoming, UC

Davis, UC San Diego, Stanford University, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, National Institute

of Polar Research in Japan, and University of Southampton in the UK.

The paper, “Maximizing biological insights from instruments attached to animals,” was funded by a

Packard Fellowship in Science and Engineering, a Beckman Young Investigator award, an Office of

Naval Research Young Investigator award, and a generous private donation through the Elysea Fund.
