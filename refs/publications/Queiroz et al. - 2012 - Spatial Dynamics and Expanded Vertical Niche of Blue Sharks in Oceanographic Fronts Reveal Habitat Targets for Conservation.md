Abstract

Dramatic population declines among species of pelagic shark as a result of overfishing have been reported, with some
species now at a fraction of their historical biomass. Advanced telemetry techniques enable tracking of spatial dynamics and
behaviour, providing fundamental information on habitat preferences of threatened species to aid conservation. We tracked
movements of the highest pelagic fisheries by-catch species, the blue shark Prionace glauca, in the North-east Atlantic using
pop-off satellite-linked archival tags to determine the degree of space use linked to habitat and to examine vertical niche.
Overall, blue sharks moved south-west of tagging sites (English Channel; southern Portugal), exhibiting pronounced site
fidelity correlated with localized productive frontal areas, with estimated space-use patterns being significantly different
from that of random walks. Tracked female sharks displayed behavioural variability in diel depth preferences, both within
and between individuals. Diel depth use ranged from normal DVM (nDVM; dawn descent, dusk ascent), to reverse DVM
(rDVM; dawn ascent, dusk descent), to behavioural patterns where no diel differences were apparent. Results showed that
blue sharks occupy some of the most productive marine zones for extended periods and structure diel activity patterns
across multiple spatio-temporal scales in response to particular habitat types. In so doing, sharks occupied an extraordinarily
broad vertical depth range for their size (1.0–2.0 m fork length), from the surface into the bathypelagic realm (max. dive
depth, 1160 m). The space-use patterns of blue sharks indicated they spend much of the time in areas where pelagic
longlining activities are often highest, and in depth zones where these fisheries particularly target other species, which
could account for the rapid declines recently reported for blue sharks in many parts of the world’s oceans. Our results
provide habitat targets for blue shark conservation that may also be relevant to other pelagic species.

Introduction

Information on movements and behaviour

is an often
overlooked, but nevertheless crucial part of assessing population
trends of mobile animals since at specific locations movement
greatly influences temporal changes in population density [1].
However, for many exploited marine animals such as large fishes,
accurate fisheries-independent population assessments of space use
are still lacking, hampering effective conservation and manage-
ment efforts. Understanding patterns of habitat use, both
horizontal and vertical,
in marine predators with regards to
physical features of the environment is important because they
influence predators’ movements and distribution to a large degree
[2], and aid our prediction of animal behaviour in the face of
changing environmental conditions [3]. Moreover, such informa-
tion is valuable for management purposes, especially in species

that are at risk from expanding fisheries [4,5]. In the North
Atlantic alone, many pelagic species which undergo long-distance
movements or migrations are vulnerable to large-scale fishing
pressure, either from directed or incidental captures [5,6,7]. In
particular, the estimated abundance of oceanic sharks has declined
by between 21 and 99% in recent years when compared with
estimates preceding extensive exploitation [8,9]. Commonly
reported as

and 1990s [6,12].

Longline surveys and mark-recapture studies in the Atlantic
have provided considerable information on the distribution and
extensive movements of pelagic sharks, and for blue sharks in
particular [13]. These studies naturally fail, however, to provide
a detailed understanding of how pelagic sharks respond to

plankton-feeding pelagic sharks have quantified the importance
of productive areas such as oceanographic fronts (boundaries
between different water mass types) for foraging opportunities
[14,15,16] or by highlighting the behavioural
such
species use when faced with habitat changes [17]. A similar

characteristic of foraging occurring in productive regions, and
it is reasonably well documented in tunas [3,20]. However, no
comparable studies on predatory pelagic sharks have been
undertaken in the Atlantic Ocean, where longline fishing
pressure is up to eight-fold higher (Fig. S1). In this context, it
is important to determine association rates of Atlantic sharks
with strong environmental gradients (e.g. sea surface tempera-
ture, SST) that are often targets for intensive fishing activities
[21,22].

zooplankton to large vertebrates [e.g. 17,23,24]. Diel vertical

thought to be a trade-off between reduced predation risk with
increasing depth, and improved feeding opportunities in prey-

relative changes in light intensity are also a principal driver of
diel migrations [27]. Hence, so-called normal DVM is often
characterised by an ascent into shallow water at sunset followed
by a descent at sunrise to greater depths (dusk – ascent; dawn –
descent). In addition, diel migration patterns may be regulated
by physical oceanographic structures (stratification, eddies) and
by the depth of the chlorophyll maximum layer [28]. Similar
changes in the timing of vertical migration have been observed
in larger invertebrates [e.g. jellyfish, squid; 29,30] and also small
it is not surprising that large predators,
fish [31]. Therefore,
such as sharks and tunas, modify their diving behaviour in
response to diel migrating prey. As a result, diel patterns of
activity in apex predators have frequently been linked to
foraging or search behaviour [32,33]. In these studies pelagic
fish displayed consistent diel patterns of vertical movement at
temporal scales, geographic regions and across life-
different
history stages (i.e.
frequently with increased
diving activity rhythms at specific periods of the day. Additional
theories to explain diel changes in behaviour have also been
proposed. For example, diel depth changes in a demersal shark
have been linked to increased bioenergetic efficiency, whereby
sharks hunt in warm surface waters at night and rest in cooler
waters during the day [34]. It has also been shown that fish
may alter diving behaviour in an attempt to minimise predation
risk [35].

Blue Shark Space-Use and Diel Behaviour

Methods

Study species

The blue shark is a wide-ranging shark occurring in all tropical
and temperate seas. Distribution of the Atlantic population is
complex with spatial and temporal segregation by sex and age,
in addition to short and longer range seasonal and annual
migrations,
including trans-Atlantic and trans-equatorial move-
ments [36]. In the eastern Atlantic adult females are found around
the Canary Islands and North Africa in winter, many of which are
pregnant [36]. Adult males are found further north, mainly off
Portugal, along with juveniles and sub-adult females, the latter
group undertaking a summer migration into the western English
Channel and Irish waters [37,38]. Adult males and juveniles are
also found in offshore regions, particularly off the Azores [39].
Mark-recapture studies have, however, also shown apparent
long-term site fidelity to specific, relatively localised regions by
some components of the population [40], although such studies
are largely influenced by the spatial and temporal distribution of
fishing effort, and likely reflect the movement of the fishing vessels
rather than describing actual movement or residence patterns of
blue sharks [41].

Shark tagging

level

south-west England and off

Blue sharks were captured using rod and line and brought
onboard for body-length measurement and tagging. Fishing took
place between July 2006 and June 2008 in two areas: the English
Channel off
southern Portugal
(Fig. 1A). A total of 16 blue sharks were tagged with PSAT tags
in these two sites. Shark 1 was tagged with a Mark 4 PSAT tag
(PAT4, Wildlife Computers, WA, USA), which records depth
(maximum: 1000 m; accuracy: 0.5 m), water temperature (range:
240 to 60uC; accuracy: 0.05uC) and light
(at 550 nm
wavelength) and relays data via an Argos-certified satellite
transmitter. The tag was programmed to sample each parameter
every 10 s and detach after 30 days. The remaining sharks (#2–
16) were tagged with Mk10 PSAT tags (Wildlife Computers).
Parameters were sampled throughout the deployment at varying
intervals (from 1 to 10 s) and stored as summary data over set
intervals of 4 or 6 h. For each integration interval, PSAT tags
relayed information on the minimum and maximum depth
obtained and selected temperatures across this range so that
temperature/depth profiles could be generated. Tags were
programmed to detach after 60, 90, 120 or 180 days after tagging.
In 2006/2007, PSATs were attached via a 20-cm long
monofilament tether (250 lb test) tether connected to a 5 cm long
stainless steel T-bar arrowhead; in 2008 tags were rigged with a
15-cm monofilament tether and an ‘umbrella’ type nylon dart. All
tags were inserted into the dorsal musculature at a 45u angle to a
maximum depth of 10 cm.

Horizontal movements and space-use

The movement of each shark was estimated using either satellite
relayed data from each tag or from archival data after the tags
were physically recovered. Positions of each shark between
attachment and tag pop-up were reconstructed using software
provided by the manufacturer (WC-GPE, global position estima-
tor program suite), where daily maximal rate-of-change in light
intensity is used to estimate local time of midnight or midday for
longitude calculations, and day-length estimation for determining
latitude. Anomalous
longitude estimates resulting from dive-
induced shifts in the estimated timings of dawn and dusk from
light curves were discarded from the dataset. Geolocations .3u of
longitude from the previous longitude estimate were also removed

[16]. Latitude along the longitude was then corrected by matching
minimum and maximum tag-recorded water temperatures from
the shallowest bin recorded in each period to sea surface
temperature (SST) values on night-time, 8-day composite,
moderate-resolution,
imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) re-
mote-sensing images. The most parsimonious location was derived
by matching individual pixel SSTs within a variable-sized circular
area (radius 100–500 km) around the previous tag position. If no
matches were obtained within the smaller area, the radius was
increased until matches occurred. Variable-sized areas were used
because geolocations at constant
intervals were not always
determined due to gaps in the data. A geographic mean position
was calculated from all possible pixel locations within this area to
derive each shark position. Maximum dive depth was compared
with seabed depths from a digital bathymetry map (general
bathymetric chart of the oceans GEBCO 300 dataset) within each
area to filter anomalous positions where the dive depth was greater
than seabed depth. Using the ArcGIS geographical information
system (ESRI Inc., CA, USA),
intermediate waypoints were
applied to track steps where trajectories between located positions
crossed land. The final estimated positions were then analysed
point-to-point with a 1 m s21 swim speed filter, which is the

maximum over-the-ground swimming speed measured for blue
sharks [42] and is consistent with swimming speeds of other
pelagic sharks. A position separated from an adjacent position
by a distance too great to achieve in the speed-filter-imposed
time between those points was shifted to a location along the track
where the forced speed limit provided an acceptable distance.
Previous studies using this general method estimated the mean
error distance of light/SST geolocation compared to tagging or
pop-up locations to be 75.5 km654.5 S.D. (range: 36.9–183.9 km)
[16] and 78.0 km621.4 S.D (range: 54.7–100.0 km) [43].

Shark tracks were initially partitioned into 1 h data points; the
interpolated points were then plotted against a 0.560.5u grid in
ArcGIS. Total time spent in each grid cell was calculated by
summing the number of hourly points located within them (Fig.
S2A). To test if the observed movement patterns (and in particular
the aggregations at some cells) were different from simple random
movement, a Brownian normal diffusion random-walk model was
used. For each simulation, 10 particles (model sharks) were started
from points corresponding to the actual tagging positions of blue
sharks (five were released off southwest England and five off
southern Portugal). The movement path of each particle
comprised a sequence of discrete steps and turning angles, with

the former limited by the actual number of
individual steps
recorded for each tracked shark. In each iteration, step length was
drawn from a normal distribution with an average and standard
deviation estimated from tracked sharks and limited by the
minimum and maximum step lengths observed. Angles were
derived from a uniform distribution between 2180u and +180u.
After computing a new position, a check was made to ensure that
it did not fall within land masses. If so, the position was rejected
and a new angle and step length were drawn. At the end of each
simulation, a final map with a 0.560.5u grid was constructed with
the total number of hours computed for each grid cell
(for
examples see Fig. S2B–D). A total of 5000 simulation runs of 10
model sharks were completed. To test whether the observed
pattern differed significantly from the random-walk generated
patterns,
the
number of hours per cell was computed using the simulations. The
mean/variance proportion was also computed for the observed
data and was compared with the distribution computed previously
to estimate its p value [44].

Interpolated data points were also used to calculate shark space
use by performing a kernel density estimate in ArcGIS [spatial
analyst/kernel density]. Since data was not normally distributed
(Shapiro-Wilk; W = 0.733, p,0.001), a Spearman Rank correla-
tion was carried out
to test whether there was a significant
relationship between the estimated space use and enhanced
primary production (using mean chlorophyll a concentration as a
proxy). Similarly, hourly interpolated vessel monitoring system
(VMS) data from surface longliners (tracked between 2006 and
2008 in the summer/autumn period) were used to estimate kernel
point density; a Spearman Rank correlation was subsequently
performed between the estimated longliner space use patterns
(data not normally distributed; Shapiro-Wilk; W = 0.863, p,0.001)
and mean chlorophyll a levels.

Vertical movement analysis

A modified version of the split-moving window (SMW) method
was employed to detect significant shifts in time-at-depth (TAD)
data and,
thus, define behavioural phases [3,45]. Briefly, a
variable-sized split window ranging from 4 or 6 h to a maximum
of 5 days was used to compute dissimilarities between the two
halves of the window along the time steps of the vertical track. A
multivariate measure of dissimilarity (Euclidean) was computed
between every possible pair of samples from different halves and
the values of all comparisons were then averaged. The value
obtained was assigned to the centre of the window, which then
moved one step forward, repeating this process until the window
reached the end of
the data series. Statistical significance of
dissimilarities for each window’s midpoint was computed using a
randomisation procedure. The result from each window size was
then plotted by piling them vertically, resulting in an inverted
triangle with the lower vertex pointing to the boundary location
whenever a significant shift was detected [3,45]. This modified
method has the advantage of not requiring evenly distributed data,
which is suitable for satellite-transmitted summary data, given that
it often has data gaps due to the limited bandwidth of the Argos
satellite relay system. This limits data recovery rates during the
data upload period when the tag is at the sea surface and prior to
its batteries becoming exhausted (,14 days). Data for each
behavioural phase was pooled and summarized as diel frequencies
of time spent at depth, to distinguish between different patterns of
behaviour that could be similar among sharks. T-tests were used to
determine whether there were significant day/night differences in
maximum depth and were performed at the p = 0.05 level of
significance. To test if the vertical movements of blue sharks were

linked to behavioural thermoregulation, a time-weighted average
of the temperature experienced by sharks was calculated for each
integration period, and a non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test
was performed to determine whether there were significant diel
differences in temperature.

Results

A total of six females, with body-lengths varying from 1.30 to
1.99 m (fork length, FL) were tagged off south-west England. An
additional 10 sharks, eight females (0.95 to 2.00 m FL) and two
males (1.40 and 2.00 cm FL), were tagged off southern Portugal.
Hence, juvenile, sub-adult and adult sharks were tagged in both
locations (Table 1, 2). Overall, three tags failed to uplink to Argos
satellites. With one exception (tag deployed on shark 1, S1), all
reporting tags detached prematurely between 13 and 105 days. Of
these, three reported very little archived data and no geolocations,
and as a result, no further analyses were performed. Three tags
were physically recovered and full archival datasets were
downloaded. All analyses were restricted to data recorded prior
to premature release dates. Overall, blue shark movements and
behaviour were tracked for a total of 401 days, covering an
estimated average distance of 1429.406807.74 km.

Horizontal movements and space-use

Blue sharks generally moved south-west of the tagging sites,
both in the English Channel and off southern Portugal (Fig. 1A).
Off south-west England, only S1 remained in a restricted area of
the continental shelf for the whole duration of the deployment.
The general area occupied by S1 was dominated by seasonally
persistent tidal fronts, principally the Ushant front (Fig. 2). Shark 2
(S2) moved west into the Celtic Sea shelf area, before moving
south into deeper water. Sharks 3 and 4 (S3, S4) moved south-west
along the edges of the highly productive Ushant front into the Bay
of Biscay region of the continental shelf edge, prior to moving into
deeper water; S3 was geolocated in northern Spanish waters in late
August. S5 initially moved south, crossing the frontal region, and
arrived at the shelf edge in late August, approximately 10 d after
tagging. This
shark continued to move southeast along the
continental shelf edge for ,18 d, and in late September was
geolocated off the northern Spanish coast, where it remained until
late October. By early November the shark had moved north and
was captured by a longline fishing vessel near the shelf edge. Off

south-west into deeper water. Shark 8 (S8) also moved in a
south-westerly direction into oligotrophic waters (Fig. 2b) and was
geolocated near the Canary Islands in late June, remaining in the
area for approximately 50 d. Shark 7 (S7) moved southwest along
the African coast, also being geolocated near the Canary Islands
by mid-November. Sharks 9 and 10 (S9, S10) were tagged on the
same day 1 h apart; both sharks displayed an initial southward
movement towards the African coast, with S9 remaining in this
upwelling region for ,40 d, until the tag popped-up in early
August. S10 continued to move south, past the Canary Islands,
reaching the Western Sahara upwelling system in mid-July
(Fig. 1A, Fig. 2).

into the western coast

The estimated space use pattern was statistically different from
spatial distributions calculated from random walks (p,0.05). The
observed high persistence of sharks in some grid cells caused the
variance to increase in relation to the average time spent per cell.
Shark space use was also correlated with chlorophyll a concen-
tration (Spearman Rank correlation; rs = 0.24, p,0.05). Hence,
excluding tagging areas (where high space use results from tagging

tracked female blue sharks
concentrated in five major areas (A–E; Fig. 1B). These regions
are characterised by the presence of thermal front boundaries and
associated enhanced primary production (Fig. 2) [46].

Diel vertical movements

Blue sharks demonstrated a wide vertical distribution, inhabit-
ing depths from the surface to a maximum of 1160 m (S10), to our
knowledge the deepest dive depth recorded for this species, and
spanning water temperatures from 7.2 to 27.2uC. Moreover, all
sharks displayed significant variations in diving behaviour, phases
of which were detected by the split-moving window procedure
[3,45]. Overall, five general behaviour types could be identified,
ranging from normal DVM (nDVM) to reverse DVM (rDVM),
and including behavioural patterns where no diel differences were
apparent.

The first nDVM pattern was characterised by a continued
residence at depth during daylight hours, with sharks spending
between 70 and 100% of time below the thermocline (,100 m).
Night time time-at-depth (TAD) occupation was irregular, but
,50% of the time was spent diving in the mixed layer (Fig. 3A).
This behaviour was only observed in stratified, productive

shelf-edge waters of the Bay of Biscay and off western Africa
(Table 2). In the second identified nDVM pattern sharks usually
spent ,80% of
the day near the surface, but consistently
performed deeper dives during the day than during the night
(p,0.05, n = 346). Daytime maximum dive depths averaged
247614 m (mean 6 SE, n = 177), whereas night time maximum
dive depths averaged 18069 m (n = 169). Hence, a second
favoured depth range below the thermocline was noticeable,
where 10–20% of time was spent. This behaviour was often
associated with stratified water (Fig. 3B; Table 2) and the night
time depth-range was largely restricted to the mixed layer above
the thermocline.

When in shallow shelf waters off England, blue sharks tagged in
2007 displayed a reverse diel vertical migration (rDVM) pattern,
spending about 60% of time at depth during the night, and over
60% of time in the top 20 m during the day (Fig. 4). Depth-
temperature profiles of the water column indicated sharks were
diving through generally isothermal, well-mixed water (Fig. 4,
right panel).

Surface-oriented behaviour was only observed in stratified water
with both day and night time TAD occupation generally restricted
to thermocline depths (Fig. 5A). Sharks showed no differences

between night and daytime behaviour in either TAD or maximum
depth (p = 0.76, n = 253), with individual
sharks performing
occasional deep, fast dives below the thermocline. Finally, blue
sharks in oceanic areas also showed apparently irregular diving
behaviour with no obvious differences between light-dark cycles in
either TAD or diving depth (p = 0.44, n = 78), which typically
ranged from the surface to ,200–1160 m (Fig. 5B). Irregular diel
behaviour was only displayed in isothermal water (Table 2).

Discussion

The results of tagging blue sharks with satellite-linked archival
transmitters indicate that female sharks display fidelity to localised
high-productivity regions characterised by the presence of thermal

fronts, at least for the time periods over which they were tracked.
Blue shark diel behaviour showed extensive variability, both within
and between individuals: diving behaviour ranged from patterns
where differences in diel vertical migration were observed, to
patterns where no day-night differences were apparent. The study
also demonstrated that blue sharks are capable of bathypelagic
dives to at least 1160 m.

Number-tagged blue sharks in south-western English waters and
off Ireland have previously been recaptured in the Bay of Biscay in

temperate and warm-water zones have also been described.

Africa, female blue sharks have been recaptured off the Canary
Islands (and further south) in winter and spring months [36,37,40].
In this
study, blue sharks displayed broad-scale horizontal
movements away from the tagging sites, moving across different
habitat types, from shelf, shelf-edge and into deep oceanic water.
However, movements remaining within spatially restricted areas
the Celtic Shelf, Bay of Biscay and western Africa were
of
significantly different from distributions of model sharks moving
according to simple random walks. Blue shark movements were
statistically correlated, albeit weakly, with frontal regions. A low
correlation between space use and chlorophyll a concentration was
not unexpected, as there is a spatial and temporal mismatch
between shark location and remotely sensed data. The former
arises from the limited spatial accuracy of light level geolocation of
pop-up satellite tags, whereas
from the
unevenness of remote sensed data (e.g.
lack of data as a
consequence of cloud cover) which forces pooling at wider
temporal scales. Despite these limitations, a general correlation
between space use and enhanced productivity areas was present in
our tracking data. Our type of study will benefit from the recent
development of tags with greater spatial accuracy (e.g. GPS) [47],
as well as from advances in remote sensing instrumentation and
improvements in interpolation algorithms which have resulted in
spatially complete, ultra-high temporal and spatial resolution
products.

the latter derives

Frontal zones are typically characterised by high primary and
secondary production, where physical processes passively aggre-
gate plankton and therefore generally concentrate higher abun-
dances of prey species [48,49]. Hence, frontal zones represent
regions of forage accumulation [50] and higher in situ primary
growth [51], and are known to influence the movement and
distribution of marine predators [52,53]. Prolonged residence in
productive ‘hotspots’ has been described for several species, from
birds [54,55], fish [17,20], turtles [56,57] to marine mammals
[58]. In a parallel study in the North-eastern Atlantic, blue sharks
tagged with near real-time Argos transmitters, also spent more
time in rich frontal zones off the Iberian Peninsula, Bay of Biscay
and Celtic Shelf (Fig. S3). Likewise, basking (Cetorhinus maximus)
and porbeagle sharks (Lamna nasus) satellite tracked in the same
general area, displayed restricted movements and high space-use

of fine to large-scale frontal features [14,15,43]. These findings
coupled with our results, suggest predators may orientate to high-
productivity frontal areas to find food in more predictable habitat
then in other areas. Once abundant prey patches are located,
predators may remain in these discrete regions for extended
periods of time, as seen for tracked blue sharks in this study, which
ultimately leads to their spatial aggregation [14]. As well as
spending extended periods of time in one area, tracked blue sharks
also moved into oligotrophic waters. Although the reasons for
these large-scale movements are unknown, they might be linked
with dispersing food resources or associated with search for widely
distributed prey [58,59].

Diel vertical movements

such as

likely as an explanation. Of

Several hypotheses could be proposed to account for differences
foraging,
in the diel behaviour of pelagic sharks,
thermoregulation, predator avoidance and/or orientation. How-
ever, as there is no empirical evidence for deep dives (generally
performed during daytime) playing a role in the navigational
abilities or processes of sharks, diel behavioural orientation seems
the remaining hypotheses,
less
predator avoidance seems equally unlikely, since we would then
expect diel patterns to differ between sharks of different sizes, from
juveniles to adults [35]: however, such differences were not
observed in satellite tracked sharks in this study (Table 2). If
behavioural thermoregulation was responsible for the observed
diel patterns the vertical movements of tracked sharks should be
regularly linked to thermocline depths, with blue sharks occupying
on a daily basis water masses with different temperatures [34].
Again, this hypothesis was not supported by our tracking data
(U = 63042.5, t = 138395.5, P = 0.08). Moreover, a recent study of
blue sharks in the western Atlantic also demonstrated that diving
patterns were not consistent with movements associated with
behavioural thermoregulation [60]. Instead, our results indicate
that blue sharks belonging to varying age groups exhibited similar
diel behavioural strategies at different geographical areas, thus
supporting the hypothesis that differences in diel behaviour were
likely linked to foraging.

In well-stratified off-shelf

regions, zooplankton organisms
predominantly undertake regular vertical movements, generally

occurring at depth during the day and approaching the surface
during the night. Downward migrations of zooplankton occur at
sunrise and upwards at sunset and are thought to be an adaptive
response to reduce predation risk [23]. Normal DVM diving
patterns were commonly observed in blue sharks tracked by us,
but there were significant differences in diel diving behaviour. In
shelf-break regions blue sharks displayed a continuous residence at
depth during the day, while swimming near the surface at night.
This pronounced diel migratory pattern is consistent with tracking
suggesting sharks
such as
vertically migrating prey,
maximised the time spent within a prey patch (see below). This
behaviour has recently been observed for blue sharks in the
northwest Atlantic [60], suggesting that residence at depth may be
a more common occurrence than previously thought in frontal

squid,

systems, such as the Gulf Stream or the Biscay shelf edge. Thus far,
such marked nDVM behaviour has only been observed in
relatively few large predatory fish, such as bigeye tuna (Thunnus
obesus) [33], swordfish (Xiphias gladius) [61] and bigeye thresher
shark (Alopias superciliosus) [62].

In this study, blue sharks displaying the second nDVM pattern
spent more time near the surface during the day and night, but
displayed a distinct normal diel component in maximum depth,
repeatedly diving deeper during the day, while night
time
excursions were frequently limited to thermocline depths. Deep
descents below the mixed layer during daylight hours most likely
represent foraging dives. Furthermore, the uniformity of dive
depth (between 200–400 m) implies prey patches remained in a
confined depth layer. The stomach content of blue sharks also

suggests foraging at depth, with deep-water squid known to be an
important item in the diet of this species in the region where we
tracked them [63]. An ongoing study in the North-eastern Atlantic
reveals a clear dominance of cephalopod prey items in the
stomach contents of longline-caught blue sharks (index of relative
importance, IRI, of 94%); deep-water squid species such as
Vampyroteuthis
sp. were commonly
identified (N. Queiroz, unpublished data). This indicates blue
sharks may forage on cephalopods at considerable depths.

infernalis and Mastigoteuthis

Over the European continental shelf, blue sharks in well-mixed
or weakly stratified water showed a pattern consistent with reverse
diel vertical migration (rDVM) behaviour. A similar behavioural
pattern has been described for basking and porbeagle sharks
tracked over the continental shelf [17,43]. Interestingly, rDVM
behaviour was observed in basking sharks foraging in inner-shelf
regions characterised by tidal fronts [17]. In the former study,
reverse DVM of
linked to zooplankton
behaviour and distribution, which aggregated in surface waters
during daytime, possibly influencing schooling fish distribution.
Hence, a possible reason for the rDVM seen in tagged blue sharks
here was tracking of pelagic fish (e.g. mackerel, Scomber scombrus), or
of the predators of small pelagic fish such as squid.

tracked sharks was

Billfish and tuna species generally exhibit a marked preference
for the mixed layer, rarely crossing the thermocline, e.g. [64,65].
Likewise, blue sharks tracked in this study displayed a similar
surface-oriented behavioural pattern in stratified oceanic regions,
where no apparent diel differences in diving were observed.
Surface-oriented behaviour could indicate near-surface prey
patches are dense enough for high encounter rates [2]. Finally,
irregular diving seen in tracked blue sharks was probably related,
directly or indirectly, to changes in the thermal structure of the
water column [45]. Strikingly,
this behavioural pattern was
observed in S8 and S10 while the sharks were associated with
well-mixed waters, typical of the Western Sahara upwelling region
[66]. Overall, shifts in the diel behaviour of blue sharks may be
related to changes in prey type or density, e.g. low prey levels near
the surface may induce foraging at depth [2], although in some
circumstances, these behavioural changes may have also been
direct responses to the thermal profile of the water column, which
can influence the availability of prey resources [17].

Future research in this area would benefit

from studies
focusing on resolving the movements of predatory sharks, and
other large pelagic vertebrates,
in relation to the distribution
and abundance of their prey species. This would enable more
process-based investigations aimed at identifying how and under
what conditions sharks search for prey. Furthermore, there is a
need for more information about the movements of male sharks,
and for both sexes in the winter and spring period so as to
build a more complete picture of blue shark population structuring
in the eastern north Atlantic [67], which will be important for
their conservation and management in the face of high fishing
pressure.

Fisheries and behaviour

Blue sharks are commonly caught as bycatch in longlines
targeting swordfish and tuna species, e.g. [10]. Pelagic longlines
comprise a mainline, which can extend up to 100 km in length,
suspended in the water column, with baited hooks on branch-lines
attached at evenly spaced intervals. Longlines are generally
deployed overnight and hooks set at depths typically ranging
from ,100 to 300 m [22,68]. Given that the observed blue
sharks night-time habitat was generally restricted to near-surface
depths (i.e. surface to ,100 m), there is therefore a spatial and
temporal overlap between the longline fishing effort and the
vertical niche of blue sharks. Hence, analysis of the recorded tracks
suggest
the vertical overlap between blue shark night-time
occupation in open ocean areas and hook depth, ranges from
,76% to as high as 100%. Strikingly, VMS data of pelagic
longliners operating in the northeast Atlantic shows longlining
significantly concentrate in high productivity areas
activities
(rs = 0.56, p,0.05; Fig. 6). Space-use patterns of satellite-linked
sharks suggest they spend much of the time in the same type of
areas where longline fisheries target commercially important
marine fish, which could account for the high levels of by-catch of
blue sharks and the rapid declines reported for this species [6,12].
Consequently, high productivity regions may be ideal habitat
targets for the implementation of high seas marine protected areas
(MPAs), not only for blue sharks, but also for other large pelagic
predators.
